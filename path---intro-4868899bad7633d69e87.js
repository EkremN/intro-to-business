I teach Digital Marketing, Service Marketing, Marketing Management and Introduction to Business. My passion is entrepreneurship. Created my first company when I was a third year student. With that company won first place in Burch startup competition. Created team, developed project, won "Regional Imagine Cup" organized by Microsoft. </p>\n<p>I\'m studying onile web development and I knid of like JsvaScript or batter to say MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). In my free time I\'m trying to lear some design Photoshop and Illustrator and I also do some sport.  </p>\n<!-- Also keep in mind that this is _hard_. Learning how to code is hard. It\'s similar to learning a foreign language where you have to learn a lot of small pieces of information to be able to make sense of the larger picture. It\'s easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you _should_ get something but don\'t. Keep your head up and keep trying. Walk away from the problem and come back later. Try explaining your problem to someone / your dog / a [rubber ducky][rubber-duck] (seriously, it works.) -->\n<!-- ## Who Am I? -->\n<!-- ![Brian drinking a beer](/images/brian.jpg)\n\nMy name is Brian Holt. I\'m presently (as of writing) a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft. That means I talk to people why I think Azure is a pretty cool place to deploy your code. I write a lot of code demos and help with some open source libraries. I\'ve taught a lot of lessons on [Frontend Masters][frontend-masters] and used to be on the frontend development podcast [Front End Happy Hour][fehh]. Previous to that, I was a senior or staff JavaScript and Node engineer at LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, Needle, KSL.com, and NuSkin.\n\nMy biggest passions in life are people and experiences. I hope by going through this course that it can improve your life in some meaningful way and that you in turn can improve someone else\'s life. My beautiful wife and I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States of America with our cute little Havanese dog Luna. I\'d almost always rather be traveling and have been fortunate to see over thirty countries in the past five years.\n\nPlease catch up with me on social media, would love to chat:\n\n* [Twitter][twitter]\n* [Instagram][instagram]\n* [GitHub][github]\n* [LinkedIn][linkedin]\n\n## Why was this course created?\n\n![Frontend Masters Logo](/images/FrontendMastersLogo.png)\n\nI love to teach. It\'s a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you\'ve gained so you can approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge your gaps in knowledge because you\'ll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a concept, I have to teach it to someone else.\n\nUnfortunately life gets in the way. These courses take dozens of hours to prepare and to get right. While I\'d love to just create content all day, I have a (awesome) day job at Microsoft that demands and deserves my full attention. However I\'m grateful to the team at [Frontend Masters][fem] for giving me deadlines and incentive to create these courses and then allowing and encouraging me to open source the materials. Not everyone has the money to pay for these courses which is why these materials are and will be forever open source for you to reference and share. I think the video content is pretty good too and so I\'d encourage you to [take a look at the videos on Frontend Masters][course] too if that\'s in the cards for you.\n\n[rubber-duck]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\n[frontend-masters]: https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/\n[fehh]: http://frontendhappyhour.com/\n[fem]: https://frontendmasters.com/\n[twitter]: https://twitter.com/holtbt\n[instagram]: https://www.instagram.com/briantholt/\n[github]: https://github.com/btholt\n[linkedin]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/btholt/\n[course]: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/ -->',frontmatter:{path:"/intro",title:"Introduction to the Course",order:0}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{order:0,path:"/intro",title:"Introduction to the Course"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:1,path:"/change",title:"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:2,path:"/economic",title:"Assessing Economic Conditions"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:3,path:"/marketplace",title:"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:4,path:"/ethics",title:"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:5,path:"/communication",title:"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:6,path:"/business-formation",title:"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:7,path:"/entrepreneurship",title:"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:8,path:"/midterm",title:"Midterm exam"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:9,path:"/accounting",title:"Accounting: Decision Making by the Numbers"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:10,path:"/finance",title:"Finance: Acquiring and Using Funds to Maximize Value"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:11,path:"/marketing",title:"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:12,path:"/product-and-promotion",title:"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:13,path:"/ps",title:"Distribution and Pricing: Product, Person, Place, Price"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:14,path:"/management-motivation-leadership",title:"Management, Motivation, and Leadership: Bringing Business to Life"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:15,path:"/human-resource",title:"Human Resource Management: Building a Top-Quality Workforce "}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:16,path:"/operations-management",title:"Operations Management: Putting It All Together"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:17,path:"/presentations",title:"Presentations"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:18,path:"/why",title:" Case Study I Start with why"}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
