When most people hear the term “product,” they immediately think of the
material things that we buy, use, and consume every day: for example, a
Samsung Galaxy, or a pair of True Religion jeans. But from a marketing
standpoint, product means much more. A product can be anything that
a company offers to satisfy consumer needs and wants; the possibilities
include not only physical goods but also services and ideas. A charity
event, cosmetic surgery, and a cooking lesson all qualify as products.

## 1. Services: A Product by Any Other Name

If a “product” includes anything that satisfies consumer
needs, services clearly fit the bill. But services have some
obvious differences from tangible goods. You often cannot
see, hear, smell, taste, or touch a service, and you can virtually
never “own” it. After math tutoring, for example, you
might possess sharper algebra skills, but you don’t own
the tutoring experience (at least not literally). Most services
embody these qualities:

* **Intangibility:** You typically cannot see, smell, taste, or
  touch a service before you buy it. Clearly, this creates
  a lot of uncertainty. Will the purchase really be worthwhile?
  Smart marketers mitigate the uncertainty by
  giving clues that suggest value. For example, the
  Formosa Café, a funky, old-time Hollywood bar and restaurant,
  plasters the walls with signed pictures of movie stars, providing “evidence” of its movie biz credentials.

* **Inseparability:** Try as you might, you simply can’t
  separate the buyer of a service from the person who
  renders it. Delivery requires interaction between the
  buyer and the provider, and the customer directly
  contributes to the quality of the service. Consider
  a trip to the doctor. If you accurately describe your
  symptoms, you’re likely to get a correct diagnosis.
  But if you simply say, “I just don’t feel normal,” the
  outcome will likely be different.

* **Variability:** This one ties closely to inseparability. A
  talented massage therapist would probably help you
  relax, whereas a mediocre one might actually create
  tension. And even the talented massage therapist
  might give better service at the end of the day than
  at the beginning, or worse service on the day she
  breaks up with her boyfriend. Variability also applies
  to the difference among providers. A massage at a
  top-notch spa is likely to be better than a massage at
  your local gym.
* **Perishability:** Marketers cannot store services for
  delivery at peak periods. A restaurant, for instance,
  only has so many seats; they can’t (reasonably) tell their 8 p.m. dinner customers to come back the next
  day at 5 p.m. Similarly, major tourist destinations, such
  as Las Vegas, can’t store an inventory of room service
  deliveries or performances of Cirque du Soleil. This
  creates obvious cost issues; is it worthwhile to prepare
  for a peak crowd but lose money when it’s slow? The
  answer depends on the economics of your business.

### 1.1 Goods versus Services: A Mixed Bag

Identifying whether a product is a good or a service
can pose a considerable challenge, since many products
contain elements of both. A meal at your local
Italian restaurant obviously includes tangible goods: you
definitely own that calzone. But someone else took your
order, brought it to the table, and (perhaps most importantly)
did the dishes! Service was clearly a crucial part of
the package.
A goods and services spectrum can provide a valuable
tool for analyzing the relationship between the two. At one extreme, **pure goods** don’t include
any services. Examples include a bottle of ketchup
or a package of socks. At the other extreme, **pure services**
don’t include any goods. Examples include financial
consulting or a piano lesson. Other products — such as
a meal at Pizza Hut — fall somewhere between the poles.

### 1.2. Product Layers: Peeling the Onion

When customers buy products, they actually purchase
more than just the good or service itself. They buy a complete
product package that includes a core benefit, the actual
product, and product augmentations. Understanding
these layers is valuable, since the most successful products
delight consumers at each one of them.

**Core Benefit** At the most fundamental level, consumers
buy a core benefit that satisfies their needs. When you
go to a movie, the core benefit is entertainment. When you
buy a smartphone, the core benefit is communication. And

### 1.3. Product Classification: It’s a Bird, It’s a Plane…

Products fall into two broad categories—consumer
products and business products—depending on the
reason for the purchase. Consumer
products are purchased
for personal use or consumption,
while business
products
are purchased to use either
directly or indirectly in the
production of another
product. The shoes in
your closet at home are
a consumer product,
while the shoes that you
rent at the bowling alley
are a business product.
pure goods Products that do not
include any services.
pure services Products that do
not include any goods.
consumer products Products
purchased for personal use or
consumption.
business products Products
purchased to use either directly or
indirectly in the production of other
products. when you go to the doctor, the core benefit is better health.
Most products also provide secondary benefits that help
distinguish them from other goods and services that meet
the same customer needs. A secondary benefit of a smartphone
might include entertainment, since it probably plays
your music, too.

## 2. Product Differentiation and Planning: A Meaningful Difference

While some products have succeeded with little or no
forethought, you’ll dramatically boost your chance of a
hit with careful planning. Product differentiation
should be a key consideration. Winning products must
embody a real or perceived difference versus the glut of
goods and services that compete in virtually every corner
of the market. But different alone isn’t enough; different
from, and better than, the competition are both critical in
order to create the shortest path to success.

Product quality relates directly to product value, which
comes from understanding your customer. Peter Drucker,
a noted business thinker, writer, and educator, declared:

_Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier
puts in. It’s what the customer gets out and is willing to
pay for. A product is not quality because it is hard to make
and costs a lot of money . . . this is incompetence. Customers
pay only for what is of use to them and gives them
value. Nothing else constitutes quality._

In other words, a high-quality product does a great
job meeting customer needs. Siemens, a huge electronics
conglomerate, embodies this thinking in its approach
to quality: “Quality is when our customers come back and
our products don’t.”

But the specific definition of quality—and the attributes
that indicate quality—changes across product categories.
**Quality level** refers to how well a product
performs its core functions. You
might think that smart companies
deliver the highest possible
level of performance, but this is
seldom profitable, or even desirable.

For instance, only a tiny group
of consumers would pay for a speedboat to go 200 mph, when 80 mph offers a sufficient
thrill (at least for most of us!). The right level of
product performance is the level that meets the needs
of your consumers, and those needs include price. Decisions
about quality level must also consider the competition.
The goal is to outperform the other players in
your category while maintaining profitability.

The second dimension of quality is **product
consistency**. How consistently does your product actually
deliver the promised level of quality? With a positive relationship
between price and performance, consistent delivery
can offer a competitive edge at almost any quality level.
Honda offers an excellent example. When most people
consider the Accord, the Civic, and the CRV, all Hondaowned
models, quality quickly comes to mind. And all
three dominate their markets. But clearly, the quality levels
(and price) are different for each. The Accord serves the upper,
more conservative end of the market; the Civic tends
to appeal to younger, hipper, more budget-minded consumers;
the CRV tends to appeal to middle-of-the-road
shoppers seeking a reliable, small SUV. In short, Honda succeeds
at delivering product consistency at several markedly
different quality levels.

### 2.1. Branding

At the most basic level, a **brand** is a product’s identity that
sets it apart from other players in the same category. Typically,
brands represent the combination of elements such
as product name, symbol, design, reputation, and image.
But today’s most powerful emerging brands go far beyond
the sum of their attributes. They project a compelling
group identity that creates brand fanatics: loyal customers
who advocate for the brand better than any advertising
a marketer could buy. The overall value of a brand to an
organization—
the extra money that consumers will spend
to buy that brand—is called **brand equity**.

**Brand Name** A catchy, memorable name is among the
most powerful elements of your brand. While the right
name will never save
a bad business, it can
launch a good business
to new heights. But finding
the right name can
be tough. According to
the respected Brighter
Naming consulting
group, the following
characteristics can help:

1. Short, sweet, and
   easy to pronounce
   and spell: Examples
   include Sprite, H&M,
   GE, Nike, and Visa.
2. Unique within the industry: Think Caterpillar, Yahoo!,
   Starbucks, Zara, and Google.
3. Good alliteration, especially for long names: The words
   should roll off your tongue. Some examples are Coca-Cola,
   BlackBerry, Dunkin Donuts, Weight Watchers, and
   Minute Maid.

## 3. Innovation and the Product Life Cycle: Nuts, Bolts, and a Spar k of Brilliance

For a business to thrive long term, effective new product
development is vital. And the process works only if it happens
quickly. As technological advances hit the market at
breakneck speed, current products are becoming obsolete
faster than ever before. The need for speed compounds as
hungry competitors crowd every niche of the market. But
the rush is risky, since new product development costs
can be in the millions, and the success rate is less than a
third. Marketers who succeed in this challenging arena devote
painstaking effort to understanding their customers,
but they also nurture the creativity they need to generate new ideas. An example of how this can work: The 3M
Corporation—makers of Post-It Notes and Scotch Tape—
introduces about 500 new products per year by pushing its
employees to “relentlessly ask, ‘What if?’” Some innovative
firms, such as Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, also encourage
workers to spend 20% of their work time (paid work
time!) on projects of personal interest.

### 3.1. Types of Innovation

Clearly, the first personal computer represented a higher
degree of newness than the first personal computer with
a color screen. And the computer with a color screen represented
a higher degree of newness than the first lowcost
knockoff. Levels of innovation fall along a spectrum,
as shown in Exhibit 12.6.
**Discontinuous Innovations** - are brand-new ideas that radically change how people live.
Examples include the first car, the first television, and the first
computer. These dramatic innovations require extensive customer
learning, which should guide the marketing process.

**Dynamically Continuous** continuous innovations are characterized by marked changes to existing products. Examples include cell phones, Blu-ray discs, and digital cameras. These types of
innovations require a moderate level of consumer learning
in exchange for significant benefits.

**Continuous Innovation** A slight modification of an
existing product is called a continuous innovation. Examples
include new sizes, flavors, shapes, packaging, and design.
The goal of continuous innovation is to distinguish
a product from the competition. The goal of a knockoff is
simply to copy a competitor and offer a lower price.

### 3.2. The New Product Development Process

An efficient, focused development process will boost your
chances of new product success. The standard model includes six stages:

**Idea Generation:** Some experts estimate that it
takes 50 ideas for each new product that makes it to
market, so you should definitely cast a wide net. Ideas
can come from almost anywhere, including customer
research, customer complaints, salespeople, engineers,
suppliers, and competitors.

**Idea Screening:** The purpose of this stage is to
weed out ideas that don’t fit with the company’s
objectives and ideas that would clearly be too
expensive to develop. The Walt Disney Company,
for instance, would certainly
eliminate the idea of an XXX
cable channel because it just
doesn’t fit their mission.

**Analysis:** The purpose of the
analysis stage is to estimate
costs and forecast sales for each idea to get a sense of the potential profit and
of how the product might fit within the company’s
resources.
Each idea must meet rigorous standards
to remain a contender.

**Development:** The development process leads to
detailed descriptions of each concept with specific
product features. New product teams sometimes also
make prototypes, or samples, that consumers can
actually test. The results help fully refine the concept.

**Testing:** This stage involves the formal process of
soliciting feedback from consumers by testing the
product concept. Do they like the features? Are
the benefits meaningful? What price makes sense?
Some companies also test-market their products or
sell them in a limited area to evaluate the consumer
response.

**Commercialization:** This stage entails introducing
the product to the general market. Two key success
factors are gaining distribution and launching
promotions. But a product that tested well doesn’t
always mean instant success. The VW Beetle, for
example, sold only 330 cars during its first year in the
United States, but it later became a hit.

### 3.3. The Product Life Cycle: Maximizing Results over Time\*\*

When marketers introduce a new product, they hope it
will last forever, generating sales and profits for years to
come. But they also realize that all products go through
a product
life cycle: a pattern of sales and profits that
typically
changes over time. The life cycle can be dramatically
different across individual products and product categories,
and predicting the exact shape and length of the
life cycle is virtually impossible. But most product categories
do move through the four distinct stages

![business life cycle.JPG](/images/business_life_cycle.JPG)

**Introduction:** This is a time of low sales and
nonexistent profits as companies invest in raising
awareness about the product and the product
category. Some categories, such as the microwave,
languish in this phase for years, while other categories,
such as computer memory sticks, zoom through
this phase. And some categories never get beyond
introduction. (Think clear beers.)

**Growth:** During the growth period, sales continue
to rise, although profits usually peak. Typically, competitors
begin to notice emerging categories in the
growth phase. They enter the market—often with
new variations of existing products—
which further
fuels the growth. Electric cars and plug-in hybrids
are currently in the growth phase, and a number of
competitors have recently entered the market.

**Maturity:** During maturity, sales usually peak. Profits
continue to decline as competition intensifies. Once a
market is mature, the only way to gain more users is to
steal them from competitors, rather than to bring new
users into the category. Weaker players begin to drop out
of the category. Gasoline-powered cars, sugared soda,
and network TV are in maturity in the United States.

**Decline:** During this period, sales and profits begin
to decline, sometimes quite rapidly. The reasons usually
relate to either technological change or change
in consumer needs. For instance, the introduction
of word processing pushed typewriters into decline,
and a change in consumer taste and habits pushed
hot cereal into decline. Competitors continue to drop
out of the category.

Familiarity with the product life cycle helps marketers
plan effective strategies for existing products and identify
profitable categories for new products. Exhibit 12.8 summarizes
typical marketing strategies and offers examples
for each phase.
Individual products also have life cycles that usually
follow the category growth pattern but sometimes vary
dramatically. Clearly, it’s in the marketer’s best interest to extend the profitable run of an individual brand as long as
possible. There are several ways to make this happen: finding
new uses for the product, changing the product, and
changing the marketing mix. For example, Dancing with
the Stars renews interest in their franchise by continually
introducing new celebrity contestants.
