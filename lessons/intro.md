Welcome to the Introduction to Business. I'm really exited to teach you this course. The main objective of this course is to presents a balanced view of business; the strengths, weaknesses, successes, failures, problems,and challenges. It provides students a base when it comes to business.

## Why Do you Need Business?

You are a programer, engineer, architect, linguist and you graduate form your department and have certain ideas and skills that you want to apply by creating company. You need to: _register your company_, _hire people_, _lead_, _motivate_, _control cash flow_, _understand environment_, _price product_ etc.

Even if you are going to hire someone who is going to do that for you. Basic understanding is necessary in order to be able to communicate with those people.    

Another case is if you want to work for someone. You need to understand culture, some business terms, way how to communicate your ideas, structure of the company, some basic business terms.
