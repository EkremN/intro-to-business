Welcome to the Introduction to Business. I'm really exited to teach you this course. The main objective of this course is to presents a balanced view of business; the strengths, weaknesses, successes, failures, problems,and challenges. It provides students a base when it comes to business.

## Why Do you Need Business?

You are a programer, engineer, architect, linguist and you graduate form your department and have certain ideas and skills that you want to apply by creating company. You need to: _register your company_, _hire people_, _lead_, _motivate_, _control cash flow_, _understand environment_, _price product_ etc.

Even if you are going to hire someone who is going to do that for you. Basic understanding is necessary in order to be able to communicate with those people.    

Another case is if you want to work for someone. You need to understand culture, some business terms, way how to communicate your ideas, structure of the company, some basic business terms.

## Who Am I? 

My name is Ekrem Nurovic. I teach Digital Marketing, Service Marketing, Marketing Management and Introduction to Business. My passion is entrepreneurship. Created my first company when I was a third year student. With that company won first place in Burch startup competition. Created team, developed project, won "Regional Imagine Cup" organized by Microsoft. 

I'm studying onile web development and I knid of like JsvaScript or batter to say MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). In my free time I'm trying to lear some design Photoshop and Illustrator and I also do some sport.  


<!-- Also keep in mind that this is _hard_. Learning how to code is hard. It's similar to learning a foreign language where you have to learn a lot of small pieces of information to be able to make sense of the larger picture. It's easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you _should_ get something but don't. Keep your head up and keep trying. Walk away from the problem and come back later. Try explaining your problem to someone / your dog / a [rubber ducky][rubber-duck] (seriously, it works.) -->

<!-- ## Who Am I? -->

<!-- ![Brian drinking a beer](/images/brian.jpg)

My name is Brian Holt. I'm presently (as of writing) a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft. That means I talk to people why I think Azure is a pretty cool place to deploy your code. I write a lot of code demos and help with some open source libraries. I've taught a lot of lessons on [Frontend Masters][frontend-masters] and used to be on the frontend development podcast [Front End Happy Hour][fehh]. Previous to that, I was a senior or staff JavaScript and Node engineer at LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, Needle, KSL.com, and NuSkin.

My biggest passions in life are people and experiences. I hope by going through this course that it can improve your life in some meaningful way and that you in turn can improve someone else's life. My beautiful wife and I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States of America with our cute little Havanese dog Luna. I'd almost always rather be traveling and have been fortunate to see over thirty countries in the past five years.

## Why was this course created?

![Frontend Masters Logo](/images/FrontendMastersLogo.png)

I love to teach. It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gained so you can approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge your gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a concept, I have to teach it to someone else.

Unfortunately life gets in the way. These courses take dozens of hours to prepare and to get right. While I'd love to just create content all day, I have a (awesome) day job at Microsoft that demands and deserves my full attention. However I'm grateful to the team at [Frontend Masters][fem] for giving me deadlines and incentive to create these courses and then allowing and encouraging me to open source the materials. Not everyone has the money to pay for these courses which is why these materials are and will be forever open source for you to reference and share. I think the video content is pretty good too and so I'd encourage you to [take a look at the videos on Frontend Masters][course] too if that's in the cards for you.
