Think about company that inspire Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, SpaceX, Starbucks, Coca-Cola. Let's start with question why those companies are so innovative? Year after year they are more innovative then their competition. And jet they are just a company like everyone else. They have access to the same talent, the same agency, the same consultants the same media. Why is that they seem to have something different?

Why are some people able to accomplish so much more than others (others, who appear to have access to better resources or who are in a better position to succeed)?

Why was it that Martin Luther King was the man who was able to lead the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960’s?

After all, there were other great orators and leaders during that time.

Why is it that the Wright Brothers were able to lead the way in the race for manned flight when
others were better qualified, better funded and equipped to do so?

It turned out that all great companies people they have some things in common. It is the idea that Simon Sinek developed and is so simple it consist of three questions. Why? How? What?

![Why](/images/why.jpg)

This explained why some people or organizations were able to inspire where others are not. Every single person on planet they know what they do 100%. Some they know how they do it. And very little amount of them know why they do it. We don't talk about profit that is result. With why we mean what is purpose? What’s your cause? What’s your belief? Why does your company exist? Why should anyone care?

People are attracted to people, companies that believe what they believe. All the great and inspiring leaders in their fields (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, SpaceX, Starbucks, Coca-Cola) all think, act and communicate in a specific way different than others.

If Apple is like everyone else their message might look like this.

* What? We make great computers.
* How? They are beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
* Why? Want to buy one?

That's how most marketing and sales are done, that's how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that.

Here's how Apple actually communicates. "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?" Totally different, right? You're ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it!

Let’s ting about Tesla:

* Why? Elon Musk, their founder, wants to make the world more beautiful. He wants to make world more beautiful, both in terms of energy, how we consume it, how we view it, infrastructure,and design.
* How? How do they do it by building elegant, efficient, innovative products.
* What? They happened to make electric cars.

People don’t buy "WHAT" you do, they buy "WHY" you do it. This is rooted in Biology (not psychology):
The human brain is broken into 3 major components (which correspond with the Golden Circle). Our **neocortex** corresponds with the “WHAT” level of the circle. It is responsible for all our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections (“HOW & WHY”) make up our **limbic** brain: which is responsible for: feelings, (trust and loyalty, etc.), all human behavior, and all decision making. It has no capacity for language. Communicating from the outside in: people understand vast amounts of complicated information like facts and/or features, but communicating from the inside out will reach what controls behavior (and thus decision making) and then they can rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where “gut decisions” come from.

If you don’t clearly know WHY you do what you do-how will you ever get people to respond to WHAT it is that you are asking them to do? (buy your product, vote for you, engage in a cause, etc.)

**Talk about what you believe and you will attract people who believe what you believe.**

Don’t hire people who need a job, hire people who believe what you believe. If you hire them for a job, they will work for your money. If you hire people who believe what you believe they will work for you with their blood, sweat and tears. Great example of this is with the Wright Brothers. Most people have not heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley.

![Why](/images/cwj86.jpg)

Back in those days flying was like .com era everyone was trying and Samuel Pierpont Langley had what we assume is the recipe for the success. If you ask someone why did your company or product failed they will give you the three things.

1. Not Enough Founds
2. Wrong People
3. Bad Market Conditions

Samuel was working to accomplish the first powered manned flight the same time as the Wright Brothers. He was well funded with 50,000$ from the War Department, to figure out this flying machine. Money was not a problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and he was extremely good connected. He knew all the big minds of the day and he hired the best that money could find and the marked conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere. Everyone was supporting him. But how is it possible that we don't know about him.

Few hundred miles away in Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe fo success. They paid for their dream with the money that they have earned from the bicycle shop, no college education, and they were not receiving positive press coverage. So why did the Wright Brothers succeed? They were consumed with a passion. They were driven by a cause, a purpose, a belief. They believed that if they could succeed they would change the course of the world. Their team worked with them from their passion, whit their blood, sweat and tears. Langley wanted fame and fortune. His team worked for the paycheck.
Wright brothers were crashing al least five time a day and eventually in 1903, they started flying and no one was there,press and all others they came few days later.

Prove that Langley was there for the wrong reason.
The day the Wright Brothers succeeded, he quit. He could have said that is an amazing discovery guys, let use my connections, money and team to improve the discovery but he didn't.

### The Law of Diffusion of Innovation

The population:

![Why](/images/Content_The_Diffusion.jpg)

* 2.5% - Innovators
* 13.5% - Early Adopters
* 34% - Early Majority
* 34% - Late Majority
* 16% - Laggards

This law tells us that if you want mass-market acceptance of an idea you must gain at least market share of 15% to 18% and you hit the “tipping point.” The Innovators and Early Adopters are comfortable making that “gut decision” because they believe something. To reach these people, you must get to their “why.” This will help you get to the “tipping point.” Early Majority and Late Majority will buy something just after you get Innovators and Early Adopters to believe what you believe.

Innovators and Early Adopters are people that stood in the line to buy new iPhone, they could easily go to the store next week and buy one off the shelf. Those are the people that spend $40,000 on flat screen TVs when they first came out even though the technology was substandard.

Let talk about examples. First is unsuccessful one TiVo. Since they came on the and in next few years they were the single best quality product on the market. They were extremely well founded and market conditions were fantastic. But TiVo failed. They have never made money. When they launched their product they were talking about what they had. They said: "We have a product that poses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking. And the cynical majority said, "We don't believe you. We dont need it, we don't like it, you are scaring us.

What if they had said, "If you are the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, do we have a product for you? It paused live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc. **People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.** And what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.

Lets talk about successful example. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mal in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. How he did that? Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in Marica who suffered in a pre-civil right America. In fact, some of his ideas wre bad. But he had a gift. He didn't do around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. And people who believed what he believed, took his case and they made it their own. They were telling other people about that. Just like that 250,000 people showed up on the right place at the right time to hear him speak. Non of those people showed up for him, they were there for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for 8 hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It was not black versus white it was 25% of the audience white. His speech was not about "I have a plan" it was about "I have a dream". He was a real leader and he inspired. We as individuals and organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.

This case study was taken from the Simon Sinek speech which you can find:
