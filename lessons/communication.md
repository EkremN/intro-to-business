Much of your success in business will depend on your ability to influence the people around you. Can you land the right job? Close the deal that makes the difference? Convince the boss to adopt your idea? Motivate people to buy your products? Excellent communicators are not only influential but also well liked, efficient, and effective. Great communication skills can dramatically boost your chance for success, while poor communication skills can bury even the most talented people.

So what exactly are “excellent communication skills”? Many students believe that great business communication equates to a knack for speaking or a flair for writing. But if that’s where you stop, you’re likely to hit a brick wall again and again as you attempt to achieve your goals. Effective __communication__ happens only when you transmit meaning — relevant meaning — to your audience.

Communication must be dynamic, fluid, and twoway, which includes listening. Seeking and understanding feedback from your audience—and responding appropriately — form the core of successful business communication. And it isn’t as easy as you may think. American novelist Russell Hoban neatly summarized the issue: “When you come right down to it, how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language?”

## Communication Barriers: “That’s Not What I Meant!”

Why is effective communication so challenging? The key issue is __noise__, which is any interference that causes the message you send to be different from the message your audience understands. Some experts define noise in terms of __communication barriers__, which arise in a number of different forms.

## Nonverbal Communication: Beyond the Words

Most of us focus on what we want to say, but how we say it matters even more. In fact, studies cited in The Wall Street Journal’s Career Journal suggest that during face-to-face communication, only 7% of meaning comes from the verbal content of the message — 38% comes from __tone of voice__, and 55% comes from body language such as __facial expressions__, __gestures__, and __posture__.

The goal of nonverbal communication should be to reinforce the meaning of your message. Random facial expressions and disconnected body language — arbitrary arm thrusts, for example — are at best distracting, and at worst clownish. But strong, deliberate nonverbal communication can dramatically magnify the impact of your messages. Here are a few examples:

## Active Listening: The Great Divider 

How we listen (or don’t listen) also sends a high-impact, nonverbal message. In fact, an old Chinese proverb asserts that to __listen well is as powerful a means of influence as to talk well__. Those who do both are unstoppable. Strong listening skills — active listening — play an obvious role in business success. The higher you go in an organization, the more you find that people are listening. Hourly employees may spend 30% of their time listening, while managers often spend 60%, and executives might spend 75% or more. Interestingly, top salespeople also tend to spend about 75% of their communication time listening.

## Choose the Right Channel: A Rich Array of Options

Figuring out the right way to send a message can be a daunting challenge, especially in light of the growing number of choices. The various options are called __communication channels__. Understanding the impact of each channel will help you make the best decision regarding which to use. Communication channels differ from one another in terms of how much information — or richness — they communicate to the recipient. Communication channel consist of: 

__Texting__ and __Instant messaging__ - Channel Richness is very low because so many of us text with as few words as possible, your
audience will pick up only the basics.

__Memos/reports__ - Channel Richness is very low. Your audience won’t gain any information from your tone or your body language.

__Email__ - Your audience learns nothing beyond your words themselves.

<iframe width="830" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QdPW8JrYzQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

__Voice mail__ - Your audience has the benefit of
hearing your tone but not seeing your body language.


__Telephone Conversation__ - Your audience benefits from hearing your tone and how it changes through the call.

__Videoconferencing__ - Especially with state-of-the-art equipment, the channel conveys much of the richness of actually being there.

__In-person presentation__ - Your audience directly experiences every element of your communication, from verbal content, to tone, to body language.

__Face-to-Face Meeting__ - Your audience experiences your full message even more directly.

Other channels might include intranet postings, WebEx and Facebook.

### Analyze Your Audience
To find the right words, begin with the needs of your audience. Consider:

__Expectations__: What kind of language do most people
use in the organization? Is it formal or informal?
Is it direct or roundabout? Should you differ from the
norm? Why or why not?

__Education__: The education level of the audience
should drive the level of vocabulary and the complexity of the message. 

__Profession__: Some professions (e.g., website development) are rife with jargon and acronyms. How
should this influence your message?

#### Be Concise

Comedian Jerry Seinfeld once said, “I will spend an hour editing an eight-word sentence into five.” While Jerry might be going a bit too far, it pays to be clear and concise in business communication. But don’t be concise at the expense of completeness; include all information that your audience may need. (It’ll save you time down the road.)

#### Avoid Slang

Unless you’re absolutely certain that your audience will understand and appreciate it, do not use slang in either written or verbal communication. The risk of unintentionally alienating yourself from your audience is simply too high.

#### Avoid Bias

Intentionally or unintentionally, words can communicate biases that can interfere with your message, alienate your audience, and call your own character into question. As a result, you will be less effective in achieving the immediate goals of your communication (and possibly any future communication as well). Three kinds of bias are common: 

__Gender Bias__  consists of words that suggest stereotypical attitudes toward a specific gender. Avoiding bias becomes tricky when you simply don’t know the gender of your audience, which often happens when you apply for a job in writing. The best solution, of course, is to find out the recipient’s name, but if you can’t do that, do not address your message to “Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam”; rather, use the title of the position (e.g., “Dear Hiring Manager).

__Age Bias__ refers to words that suggest stereotypical attitudes toward people of specific ages. In American culture, older people tend to experience negative age bias much more often than younger people. This happens despite specific federal legislation outlawing employment discrimination against people over 40 years old. The reason may be that American culture associates youth with highly valued qualities such as creativity, speed, independence, and individualism. This bias will become increasingly detrimental as the workforce ages. Here is an example of age bias: _We need someone young and dynamic in this position!_ You could easily eliminate the negative bias by simply deleting the word “young” or by replacing it with the word “energetic.” One clear benefit of eliminating bias in this case would be a broader applicant pool that might include an older person who is more dynamic than any of the younger applicants.

__Race, Ethnicity, and Nationality Bias__ can also suggest stereotypical attitudes toward specific races,ethnicities, and nationalities. Leaving aside prejudice — which is clearly wrong — the problems in this area are usually unintentional and stem from unarticulated assumptions about a person’s attitudes, opinions, and experiences. Your best plan for avoiding bias is to forgo any references to race, ethnicity, or nationality unless they are directly relevant and clearly necessary. And, of course, never simply assume that one person embodies the attitudes, opinions, and experiences of a larger group. If you communicate with each person as an individual, you will not only avoid bias but also develop deeper, more effective channels of communication.

## Create and Deliver Successful Verbal Presentations: Hook ’Em and Reel ’Em In

What do people fear most? The Book of Lists asserts that public speaking ranks number one for the majority of people, high above the fear of death at number four. So, when people say they would rather die than give a speech, they may really mean it! This section is designed to mitigate any fear you might have about public speaking by giving you guidance on how to create and deliver a high-impact verbal presentation.

### Opening

<iframe width="830" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2_VvIr1KkLo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The opening of your presentation gives you a chance to grab the attention of the audience. If your opening hooks them, you’ve boosted the likelihood that you will hold their attention throughout the presentation. But developing that hook can be a challenge. The following are some suggestions for effective hooks:

<iframe width="830" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqq1roF4C8s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

__An Interesting or Startling Statistic:__ In a presentation from a nonprofit foodbank seeking to partner with a grocery chain, you could open by sharing that “the U.S. has the largest number of homeless women and children of any industrialized nation, and 57% of homeless kids spend at least one day a month completely without food. How could we improve these devastating numbers?”

__Audience Involvement:__ Pulling the audience into your opening can be very effective. For instance, in a presentation for a clothing company: “Imagine yourself with me at 11 p.m. on a Friday night, standing in line for admission to the hottest club in New York. As we inch forward, we suddenly realize that three other women in line are wearing the exact same dress as you. . . .”

__A Compelling Story or Anecdote:__ This approach works best when it’s completely genuine, using specific details that are directly relevant to the audience. For instance, in a presentation about employee benefits, you might want to share the story of a colleague who beat cancer using the company’s innovative healthcare program.

__A Relevant Simile or Metaphor:__ Patricia Fripp, an award-winning keynote speaker, shares a simile that worked well to open a presentation for a colleague: “Being a scientist is like doing a jigsaw puzzle in a snowstorm at night. . . you don’t have all the pieces. . . and you don’t have the picture to work from.”

__Engaging Questions:__ In a presentation about customer service, you could open by asking: “How many of you have spent far too long waiting on hold for customer service that was finally delivered by a surly agent who clearly knew nothing about your question?

### Body
The most common presentation mistake is to include too many key ideas in the body of your presentation. Audiences simply cannot absorb more than two to four main points, and three are ideal. Specific examples and vivid comparisons will illustrate your points and bring them to life, while trusted sources, specific data, and expert quotations will increase your credibility and persuasiveness. Regardless of the length of your presentation, be sure to use clear transitions as you move from point to point. Just before launching into the body of your presentation, you should tell the audience your key points, ideally with visual reinforcement. Then as you move to each new point, you can refer to the blueprint that you established upfront. A clear, explicit structure will help the audience track with you as you move through your material.

### Close

Ideally, the close of your presentation will summarize your key points. Then circle back to your introduction, so that the beginning and the end serve as “bookends” for the body of your presentation. For instance, if you began by asking questions, end by answering them. If you began with an anecdote, end by referring to the same story. As an alternative (or maybe an addition), consider sharing a quotation or a bit of humor relevant to your content. Also, keep in mind that you should verbally signal to your audience that you are about to conclude. After you do so — by saying, “In summary,” for instance — be sure that you actually do conclude. Nothing alienates an audience more quickly than launching into another point after you’ve told them you’re finished! Your body language will support your conclusion if you turn off your projector and move toward the audience to answer questions. And even if you aren’t so eager to field questions, try to paste a receptive look on your face — it’ll increase your credibility and set a positive tone for the Q&A session.

### Questions

At the start of your presentation, decide whether you want to handle questions throughout your talk or save them for the end. Tell your audience your preference upfront; most of the time they will respect it. But if you do receive unwanted questions in the middle of your presentation, don’t ignore them. Simply remind the questioner that you’ll leave plenty of time for questions at the end. Not surprisingly, the best tip for handling questions is to be prepared. Since it’s tough to anticipate questions for your own presentation, you may want to enlist the help of a trusted colleague to brainstorm the possibilities. And don’t just come up with the questions—prepare the answers, too!

### Visual Aids

Studies suggest that three days after a presentation, people retain 10% of what they heard from an oral presentation, 35% from a visual presentation, and 65% from a combined visual and oral presentation. The numbers are compelling: visual aids matter. Depending on your audience, effective, high-impact visual aids could range from props to charts to mounted boards. But in business communication, PowerPoint slides are the most common option. If you use PowerPoint, consider these suggestions:
* Showing Works Better Than Simply Telling: Use pictures and other graphics whenever possible.
* Less Is More: Keep this helpful guideline in mind: no more than seven words per line, no more than seven lines per slide.
* Don’t Just Read Your Slides Aloud: Instead, paraphrase, add examples, and offer analysis and interpretation.
* Go Easy on the Special Effects: Too many sounds and too much animation can be painfully distracting.
* Don’t Let Your Slides Upstage You: Look at your audience, not at the slides. And dim the screen when you’re not specifically using it.
