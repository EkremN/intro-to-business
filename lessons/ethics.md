Ethics and social responsibility—often discussed in the same breath—are closely related, but they are definitely not the same. Ethics refers to sets of beliefs about right and wrong, good and bad; business ethics involve the application of these issues in the workplace. Clearly, ethics relate to individuals and their day-to-day decision making. Just as clearly, the decisions of each individual can affect the entire organization.

Social responsibility is the obligation of a business to contribute to society. The most socially responsible firms feature proactive policies that focus on meeting the needs of all their stakeholders — not just investors but also employees, customers, the broader community, and the environment. The stance of a company regarding social responsibility sets the tone for the organization and clearly influences the decisions of individual employees.

Although this chapter discusses ethics and social responsibility separately, keep in mind that the two areas have a dynamic, interactive relationship that plays a vital role in building both profitable businesses and a vibrant community.

## Defining Ethics: Murkier Than You’d Think

In the most general sense, ethics refer to sets of beliefs about right and wrong, good and bad. While your individual ethics stem from who you are as a human being, your family, your social group, and your culture also play a significant role in shaping your ethics.

A given country’s legal system provides a solid starting point for examining ethical standards. The function of laws elsewhere is to establish and enforce ethical norms that apply to everyone within our society. Laws provide basic standards of behavior. But truly ethical behavior goes beyond the basics. In other words, your actions can be completely legal, yet still unethical. But since the legal system is far from perfect, in rare instances your actions can be illegal, yet still ethical.

## BUSINESS EThICS: NOT AN OXYMORON

Quite simply, business ethics is the applica- tion of right and wrong, good and bad in a busi- ness setting. But this isn’t as straightforward as it may initially seem. The most challenging business decisions seem to arise when values are in conflict...when whatever you do will have negative consequences, forc- ing you to choose among bad options. These are true ethical dilemmas. (Keep in mind that ethical dilem- mas differ from ethical lapses, which involve clear mis- conduct.) Here are three hypothetical examples of ethical dilemmas:
* You’ve just done a great job on a recent proj- ect at your company. Your boss has been very vocal about acknowledging your work and the increased revenue that resulted from it. Privately, she said that you clearly earned a bonus of at least 10%, but due to company politics, she was unable to secure the bonus for you. She also im- plied that if you were to submit inflated expense reports for the next few months, she would look the other way, and you could pocket the extra cash as well-deserved compensation for your contributions.
* You run a medium-sized publishing firm, and you pride yourself on offering your employees cutting-edge benefits. One of the new benefits that you are planning to propose to your board is six months of paid maternity/paternity leave. You happen to know—because they told you in confidence — that two of your top team members are currently pregnant, and would almost certainly take advantage of the new policy if it were in place. Without the new policy, they would have to take three months of unpaid leave. You also know that if these women were each gone for six months, the workload would increase dramatically for the rest of the senior staff members (yourself included). To make matters even more complicated, you and your spouse are hoping to start your own family in about a year, and would certainly benefit from the paid leave.
* Facebook: For one week in 2012, Facebook changed the content mix in the News Feeds of more than half a million users—without asking their permission—in an effort to gauge their emotional response. While the manipulation was covered under Facebook’s terms of service, many users were outraged at what they considered an unethical psychological experiment without their permission. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg issued a classic nonapology: “It was poorly communicated. And for that communication we apologize.” In actuality, the experiment was not communicated at all.
