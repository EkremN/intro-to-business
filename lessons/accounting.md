## 1. What is accounting?

Accounting is about identifying, recording and presenting information; it is the forward scout in your business operations, surveying the landscape, and taking stock of your own position, so you know where you stand, what your weaknesses are, and where you should be allocating your resources.

Who uses the information that accounting provides? It’s a
long list (Managers, Stockholders, Employees, Creditors, Suppliers, Government agencies); after all, everyone wants to make good decisions!
In fact, a variety of business stakeholders rely so heavily on
accounting information that it’s sometimes called the “language
of business.”

We generally break down accounting into two main fields:

__Financial Accounting__ is the branch of accounting that addresses the needs of external stakeholders, including stockholders, creditors, and government regulators. These stakeholders are seldom interested in poring over detailed accounting information about the individual departments or divisions within a company. Instead, they’re interested in the financial performance of the firm as a whole. They often want to know how a firm’s financial condition has changed over a period of several years, or to compare its results to those of other firms in the same industry. The major output of financial accounting is a set of financial statements designed to provide this broad type of information.

__Managerial Accounting__ as its name implies, this branch of accounting is designed to meet the needs of a company’s managers, though in recent years many firms have empowered other employees and given them access to some of this information as well. Managers throughout an organization rely on information created by managerial accountants to make important decisions. The accuracy and reliability of this information can make a huge difference in the performance of a firm. In fact, many firms view their management accounting systems as a source of competitive advantage and regard the specifics of these systems as highly valuable company secrets.

### 1.1. Accounting: Who Does It?
Accountants work in a variety of positions to provide all of this information. Let’s take a quick look at some of the roles accountants play:

1. Public accountants provide services such as tax preparation, external auditing, or management consulting to clients on a fee basis.
2. Management accountants work within a company and provide analysis, prepare reports and financial statements, and assist managers in their own organization. Internal auditors also work within their organizations to detect internal problems such as waste, mismanagement, embezzlement, and employee theft.
3. Government accountants perform a variety of accounting functions for local, state, or federal government agencies.

Every business puts together three financial statements:

__Balance Sheet__

__Income Statement__

__Statement of Cashflows__

Taken together, these financial statements provide
external stakeholders with a broad picture of an organization’s
financial condition and its recent financial performance.

### 2.1. Role of the Financial Standards Accounting Board

Imagine how confused and frustrated investors, creditors, and regulators would become if every firm could make its own financial accounting rules as it went along and change them whenever it wanted! To reduce confusion and provide external stakeholders with consistent and accurate financial statements, the accounting profession has adopted a set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that guide the practice of financial accounting.

## 2.2. The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet summarizes a firm’s financial position at a __specific point in time__. Though the balance sheets of different firms vary in specifics, all of them are organized to reflect the most famous equation in all of accounting — so famous that it is usually referred to simply as the accounting equation: __Assets__ __=__ __Liabilities__ __+__ __Owners__ __Equity__
 
<iframe width="820" height="430" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGBOPV8q6oY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

__Assets__ are things of value that the firm owns.

__Liabilities__ indicate what the firm owes to nonowners—in other words, the claims nonowners have against the firm’s assets.

__Owners’ equity__ the claims a firm’s owners have against their company’s assets (often called “stockholders’ equity” on balance sheets of corporations).

The logic behind the accounting equation is based on the fact that firms must finance the purchase of their assets,
and owners and nonowners are the only two sources
of funding. The accounting equation tells us that the value
of a firm’s assets must equal the amount of financing provided
by owners (as measured by owners’ equity) plus the
amount provided by creditors (as indicated by the firm’s liabilities)
to purchase those assets. Because a balance sheet
is based on this logic, it must always be in balance. In other
words, the dollar value of the assets must equal the dollar
value of the liabilities plus
owners’ equity. This is true
for all firms, from the smallest
sole proprietorship to
the largest multinational
corporation.

### 2.3. The Income Statement

The income statement summarizes the financial results
of a firm’s operations over a __given period of time__. The figure
that attracts the most attention on the income statement is
net income, which measures the company’s profit or loss.

Just as with the balance sheet, we can use a simple equation to illustrate the
logic behind the organization of the income statement:
__Revenue – Expenses = Net Income__

__Revenue__ Increases in a firm’s
assets that result from the sale of
goods, provision of services, or
other activities intended to earn
income.

__Expenses__ resources that are
used up as the result of business
operations.

__Net income__ the difference between the revenue a firm earns and the expenses it incurs in a given time period.

### 2.4. Cash Flow Statement

The last major financial statement is the statement of
cash flows. Cash is the lifeblood of any business organization.
A firm must have enough cash to pay what it owes to
workers, creditors, suppliers, and taxing authorities—hopefully,
with enough left to pay a dividend to its owners! So
it’s not surprising that a firm’s stakeholders are very interested
in how and why a company’s cash balance changed
over the past year. Cash flow statements commonly begin
with net income.

The statement of cash flows looks at the “liquidity” of a company, in other words how much spendable cash it has at any given time.

It breaks up the cash activities into three categories: Operations, Investing, and Financing Activities.

1. Cash flows from __operating
activities__ show the amount
of cash that flowed into the
company from the sale of goods or services, as well
as cash from dividends and interest received from
ownership of the financial securities of other firms. It
also shows the amount of cash used to cover expenses
resulting from operations and any cash payments
to purchase securities held for short-term trading
purposes.
2. Cash flows from investing activities
show the amount of cash received
from the sale of fixed assets (such
as land and buildings) and financial
assets bought as long-term
investments. It also shows any
cash used to buy fixed assets or make long-term financial
investments.
3. Cash flows from financing activities show the cash the
firm received from issuing additional shares of its own
stock or from taking out short-term and long-term
loans.

## 3. Inside Intelligence: The Role of Managerial Accounting

Managerial (or management) accounting is the branch of accounting that provides reports and analysis to managers to help them make informed business decisions.

Without good information on costs, managers would be operating in the dark as they try to set prices, determine the most desirable mix of products, and locate areas where efficiency is lagging. A firm’s management accounting system helps managers throughout an organization measure costs and assign them to products, activities, and even whole divisions. Accountants define cost as the value of what is given up in exchange for something else. Depending on the type of problem they are analyzing, managerial accountants actually measure and evaluate several different types of costs. We’ll begin our discussion by describing some of the cost concepts commonly used by managerial accountants. At the most basic level, accountants distinguish between out-of-pocket costs and opportunity costs. __Out-of-pocket__ costs (also called explicit costs) are usually easy to measure because they involve actual expenditures of money or other resources. The wages a company pays to its workers, the payments it makes to suppliers for raw materials, and the rent it pays for office
space are examples. But accountants realize that not all costs involve a
monetary payment; sometimes what is given up is the opportunity
to use an asset in some alternative way. Such opportunity
costs are often referred to as __implicit costs__. For
example, suppose a couple of lawyers form a partnership
and set up their office in a building one of the partners
already owns. They feel good about their decision because
they don’t have to make any out-of-pocket payments for
rent. But a good managerial accountant would point out
to the partners that they still incur an implicit cost, because by using the building themselves they forgo the opportunity
to earn income by renting the office space to someone
else.

Managerial accountants also distinguish between fixed costs and variable costs. As the name implies,
__fixed costs__ don’t change when the firm changes its
level of production. Examples of fixed costs include
interest on a bank loan, property insurance premiums,
rent on office space, and other payments that are set
by a contract or by legal requirements. Many fixed costs
are really only fixed for some “relevant range” of output.
For example, if a company sees a dramatic rise in sales, it
might have to move into bigger facilities, thus incurring
a higher rent.
__Variable costs__ are costs that rise (vary) when
the firm produces more of its goods and services. As a
company ramps up its production, it is likely to need more
labor and materials and to use more electrical power. Thus
payments for many types of labor, supplies, and utilities are
variable costs.
