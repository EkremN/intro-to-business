Many people think of marketing as only selling and advertising. We are bombarded every day with TV commercials, catalogs, spiels from salespeople, and online pitches. However, selling and advertising are only the tip of the marketing iceberg. Today, marketing must be understood as <strong>satisfying customer needs</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the marketer engages consumers effectively, understands their needs, develops products that provide superior customer value, and prices, distributes, and promotes them well, these products will sell easily. In fact, according to management guru Peter Drucker, “The aim of marketing is to make selling unnecessary.”</p>\n<p><strong>We define marketing as the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id="customer-needs-wants-and-demands"><a href="#customer-needs-wants-and-demands" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Customer Needs, Wants, and Demands</h3>\n<p>The most basic concept underlying marketing is that of human <strong>needs</strong>. Human needs are states of felt deprivation. They include basic physical needs for food, clothing, warmth, and safety; social needs for belonging and affection; and individual needs for knowledge and self-expression. Marketers did not create these needs; they are a basic part of the human makeup. <strong>Wants</strong> are the form that human needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality. An American needs food but wants a Big Mac, fries, and a soft drink. A person in Papua, New Guinea, needs food but wants taro, rice, yams, and pork. Wants are shaped by one’s society and are described in terms of objects that will satisfy those needs. When backed by buying power, wants become <strong>demands</strong>. Given their wants and resources, people demand products and services with benefits that add up to the most value and satisfaction. Companies go to great lengths to learn about and understand customer needs, wants, and demands. They conduct consumer research, analyze mountains of customer data, and observe customers as they shop and interact, offline and online. People at all levels of the company — including top management — stay close to customers.</p>\n<h3 id="market-offerings--products-services-and-experiences"><a href="#market-offerings--products-services-and-experiences" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Market Offerings — Products, Services, and Experiences</h3>\n<p>Consumers’ needs and wants are fulfilled through <strong>market offerings</strong> — some combination of <strong>products</strong>, <strong>services</strong>, <strong>information</strong>, or <strong>experiences</strong> offered to a market to satisfy a need or a want. Market offerings are not limited to physical products. They also include services — activities or benefits offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in the ownership of anything. Examples include banking, airline, hotel, retailing, and home repair services. Marketing is basically present everywhere. It is just not only present in profit organizations, but is plays a crucial role for non-profit organizations as well. That being said, let us take a look at different types of marketing.</p>\n<p><strong>People marketing</strong> - sportsmen, politicians, businessmen, artist are the most common one to promote certain brands. Hilton clearly has no doubt about her abilities, declaring, “I am a marketing genius.” In fact, as you pursue your personal goals—whether you seek a new job, university admission, or a Friday night date—people marketing principles can help you achieve your objective. Start by figuring out what your “customer” needs, and then ensure that your “product” (you!) delivers above and beyond expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Place marketing</strong> – involves attracting people to certain places. It can be used to attract businessmen, or tourists.</p>\n<iframe width="830" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWIyYXKAh2E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Event marketing</strong> – includes sponsoring athletic, cultural or charitable events. E.g. FIFA world cup.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea marketing</strong> – sponsoring ideas which will make people to change how they act or think.</p>\n<iframe width="830" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjJQBjWYDTs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Many sellers make the mistake of paying more attention to the specific products they offer than to the benefits and experiences produced by these products. These sellers suffer from <strong>marketing myopia</strong>. They are so taken with their products that they focus only on existing wants and lose sight of underlying customer needs. They forget that a product is only a tool to <strong>solve a consumer problem</strong>. A manufacturer of quarter-inch drill bits may think that the customer needs a drill bit. But what the customer really needs is a quarterinch hole. These sellers will have trouble if a new product comes along that serves the customer’s need better or less expensively. The customer will have the same need but will want the new product</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/hole-712013c30830318a50bb56610d9d14b7-1828f.png"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 51.70212765957447%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAIAAAA7N+mxAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAtklEQVQoz53LOw8BQRSGYT8OBYW/oKTSaCQqOqGkoVSoRSEiKv2G6IhEZK3Lir3M2nHOnDMkErWdt/u+5Enpv7Ot6ayetkZNrfn7pHSSFuMhwus3k+FBr00KDXGukJexMMTlUhERDHG/22JShjiTyyJIQ1yrlpgpCWZiQpJCuvtOoxJddyr2SQYq9j6YmRWrF6EkeOLTA3GH0IXwhsEFvBP4DgROZG/c1eQw7z62S3FcQ3CG8PoG265Avk3l5TYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="hole"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/hole-712013c30830318a50bb56610d9d14b7-10273.png"\n        srcset="/static/hole-712013c30830318a50bb56610d9d14b7-9b14a.png 163w,\n/static/hole-712013c30830318a50bb56610d9d14b7-94962.png 325w,\n/static/hole-712013c30830318a50bb56610d9d14b7-10273.png 650w,\n/static/hole-712013c30830318a50bb56610d9d14b7-1828f.png 940w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Consumers usually face a broad array of products and services that might satisfy a given need. How do they choose among these many market offerings? Customers form expectations about the value and satisfaction that various market offerings will deliver and buy accordingly. <strong>Satisfied customers</strong> buy again and tell others about their good experiences. Dissatisfied customers often switch to competitors and disparage the product to others. Marketers must be careful to set the right level of expectations. If they set expectations too low, they may satisfy those who buy but fail to attract enough buyers. If they set expectations too high, buyers will be disappointed. Customer value and customer satisfaction are key building blocks for developing and managing customer relationships.</p>\n<h2 id="customer-value"><a href="#customer-value" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Customer Value</h2>\n<p>Once it fully understands consumers and the marketplace, marketing management can design a customer value–driven marketing strategy. We define <strong>marketing management</strong> as the art and science of choosing target markets and building profitable relationships with them. The marketing manager’s aim is to engage, keep, and grow target customers by creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value. To design a winning marketing strategy, the marketing manager must answer two important questions: <strong>What customers will we serve (what’s our target market)?</strong> and <strong>How can we serve these customers best (what’s our value proposition)?</strong></p>\n<p>Since achieving customer satisfaction is very difficult, companies usually fall in one of the two traps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The message that you are sending has to be real. Even if you deliver more value than anyone else if you do not achieve the expectations you have set, customers will not be satisfied.</li>\n<li>However, if you do not set high expectations, few customers would like to buy your product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Customer loyalty</strong> - Loyal costumers buy your products again, suggest your products, provide you with valuable feedback, forgive your mistakes. It is the payoff of delivering value.</p>\n<p>Before we fo further we need to understand difference between <strong>B2C</strong> (Business to Customer) <strong>B2B</strong> (Business to Business). Business to Consumer marketer produce products for personal consumption (e.g. car, toothpaste). On the other hand, business marketers direct their products to people who will use them to produce other products (e.g. steel, robots).</p>\n<h2 id="marketing-strategy"><a href="#marketing-strategy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Marketing Strategy</h2>\n<p>We have four major steps in designing a customer value–driven marketing\nstrategy: Segmentation, Targeting, Differentiation and Positioning.</p>\n<p>In the first two steps, the company selects the customers that it will serve. <strong>Market\nsegmentation</strong> involves dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers who have different\nneeds, characteristics, or behaviors and who might require separate marketing strategies or\nmixes. The company identifies different ways to segment the market and develops profiles of\nthe resulting market segments. <strong>Market targeting</strong> (or targeting) consists of evaluating each\nmarket segment’s attractiveness and selecting one or more market segments to enter.</p>\n<p>In the final two steps, the company decides on a value proposition—how it will\ncreate value for target customers. <strong>Differentiation</strong> involves actually differentiating the\nfirm’s market offering to create superior customer value. <strong>Positioning</strong> consists of arranging\nfor a market offering to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place relative\nto competing products in the minds of target consumers.</p>\n<h3 id="segmentation"><a href="#segmentation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Segmentation</h3>\n<p>Buyers in any market differ in their wants, resources, locations, buying attitudes, and buying\npractices. Through market segmentation, companies divide large, diverse markets into\nsmaller segments that can be reached more efficiently and effectively with products and\nservices that match their unique needs. In this section, we discuss four important segmentation\ntopics: segmenting consumer markets, segmenting business markets, segmenting\ninternational markets, and the requirements for effective segmentation. There is no single way to segment a market. A marketer has to try different segmentation variables, alone and in combination, to find the best way to view market structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Geographic segmentation</strong> calls for dividing the market into different geographical\nunits, such as nations, regions, states, counties, cities, or even neighborhoods. A company\nmay decide to operate in one or a few geographical areas or operate in all areas but pay attention\nto geographical differences in needs and wants. Moreover, many companies today\nare localizing their products, services, advertising, promotion, and sales efforts to fit the\nneeds of individual regions, cities, and other localities.</p>\n<p><strong>Demographic segmentation</strong> divides the market into segments based on variables such\nas <strong>age</strong>, <strong>life-cycle stage</strong>, <strong>gender</strong>, <strong>income</strong>, <strong>occupation</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, <strong>religion</strong>, <strong>ethnicity</strong>, and <strong>generation</strong>.\nDemographic factors are the most popular bases for segmenting customer groups.\nOne reason is that consumer needs, wants, and usage rates often vary closely with demographic\nvariables. Another is that demographic variables are easier to measure than most\nother types of variables. Even when marketers first define segments using other bases,\nsuch as benefits sought or behavior, they must know a segment’s demographic characteristics\nto assess the size of the target market and reach it efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychographic segmentation</strong> divides buyers into different segments based on lifestyle\nor personality characteristics. People in the same demographic group can have very different\npsychographic characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral segmentation</strong> divides buyers into segments based on their <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>attitudes</strong>,\n<strong>uses</strong>, or <strong>responses</strong> to a <strong>product</strong>. Many marketers believe that behavior variables are\nthe best starting point for building market segments.</p>\n<h2 id="targeting"><a href="#targeting" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Targeting</h2>\n<p>Market segmentation reveals the firm’s market segment opportunities. The firm now has\nto evaluate the various segments and decide how many and which segments it can serve\nbest. We now look at how companies evaluate and select target segments.</p>\n<p>In evaluating different market segments, a firm must look at three factors: <strong>segment size and\ngrowth</strong>, <strong>segment structural attractiveness</strong>, and <strong>company objectives and resources</strong>.</p>\n<p>First, a company wants to select segments that have the right size and growth characteristics. But “right size and growth” is a relative matter. The largest, fastest-growing segments are not\nalways the most attractive ones for every company. Smaller companies may lack the skills\nand resources needed to serve larger segments. Or they may find these segments too competitive.\nSuch companies may target segments that are smaller and less attractive, in an\nabsolute sense, but that are potentially more profitable for them.\nThe company also needs to examine major structural factors that affect long-run\nsegment attractiveness For example, a segment is less attractive if it already contains\nmany strong and aggressive competitors or if it is easy for new entrants to come into the\nsegment. The existence of many actual or potential substitute products may limit prices\nand the profits that can be earned in a segment. The relative power of buyers also affects\nsegment attractiveness. Buyers with strong bargaining power relative to sellers will try to\nforce prices down, demand more services, and set competitors against one another—all\nat the expense of seller profitability. Finally, a segment may be less attractive if it contains\npowerful suppliers that can control prices or reduce the quality or quantity of ordered\ngoods and services.</p>\n<p>Even if a segment has the right size and growth and is structurally attractive, the\ncompany must consider its own objectives and resources. Some attractive segments can\nbe dismissed quickly because they do not mesh with the company’s long-run objectives.\nOr the company may lack the skills and resources needed to succeed in an attractive\nsegment. For example, the economy segment of the automobile market is large and\ngrowing. But given its objectives and resources, it would make little sense for luxuryperformance\ncarmaker Mercedes-Benz to enter this segment. A company should only\nenter segments in which it can create superior customer value and gain advantages over\nits competitors.</p>\n<h3 id="differentiation-and-positioning"><a href="#differentiation-and-positioning" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Differentiation and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Beyond deciding which segments of the market it will target, the company must decide on\na value <strong>proposition</strong> — how it will create differentiated value for targeted segments and what\npositions it wants to occupy in those segments. A product position is the way a product\nis defined by consumers on important attributes — the place the product occupies in consumers’\nminds relative to competing products. Products are made in factories, but <strong>brands happen\nin the minds of consumers</strong>.</p>\n<p>To build profitable relationships with target customers, marketers must understand customer\nneeds and deliver more customer value better than competitors do. To the extent\nthat a company can differentiate and position itself as providing superior customer value,\nit gains competitive advantage.\nBut solid positions cannot be built on empty promises. If a company positions its\nproduct as offering the best quality and service, it must actually differentiate the product\nso that it delivers the promised quality and service. Companies must do much more\nthan simply shout out their positions with slogans and taglines. They must first live\nthe slogan. For example, online shoes and accessories seller Zappos’s “powered by service”\npositioning would ring hollow if not backed by truly outstanding customer care.\nZappos aligns its entire organization and all of its people around providing\nthe best possible customer service. The online seller’s number-one core\nvalue: “Deliver WOW through service.”</p>\n<h3 id="35-the-marketing-mix"><a href="#35-the-marketing-mix" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>3.5. The Marketing Mix</h3>\n<iframe width="830" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mco8vBAwOmA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>The marketing mix, is one of the major concepts in modern marketing. The marketing mix is the set of tactical marketing tools that the firm blends to produce the response it wants in the target market. The marketing mix consists of everything the firm can do to engage consumers and deliver customer value. The many possibilities can be collected into four groups of variables — the four Ps.</p>\n<p><strong>• Product</strong> means the goods-and-services combination the company offers to the target\nmarket. Thus, a Ford Escape consists of nuts and bolts, spark plugs, pistons, headlights, and thousands of other parts. Ford offers several Escape models and dozens of optional features. The car comes fully serviced and with a comprehensive warranty\nthat is as much a part of the product as the tailpipe.</p>\n<p><strong>• Price</strong> is the amount of money customers must pay to obtain the product. For example,\nFord calculates suggested retail prices that its dealers might charge for each Escape.\nBut Ford dealers rarely charge the full sticker price. Instead, they negotiate the price\nwith each customer, offering discounts, trade-in allowances, and credit terms. These\nactions adjust prices for the current competitive and economic situations and bring\nthem into line with the buyer’s perception of the car’s value.</p>\n<p><strong>• Place</strong> includes company activities that make the product available to target consumers.\nFord partners with a large body of independently owned dealerships that\nsell the company’s many different models. Ford selects its dealers carefully and\nstrongly supports them. The dealers keep an inventory of Ford automobiles, demonstrate\nthem to potential buyers, negotiate prices, close sales, and service the cars\nafter the sale.</p>\n<p><strong>• Promotion</strong> refers to activities that communicate the merits of the product and persuade\ntarget customers to buy it. Ford spends nearly $2.5 billion each year on U.S.\nadvertising to tell consumers about the company and its many products.11 Dealership\nsalespeople assist potential buyers and persuade them that Ford is the best car for\nthem. Ford and its dealers offer special promotions—sales, cash rebates, and low financing\nrates—as added purchase incentives. And Ford’s Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,\nInstagram, and other social media platforms engage consumers with the brand and\nwith other brand fans.</p>\n<p>An effective marketing program blends the marketing mix elements into an integrated\nmarketing program designed to achieve the company’s marketing objectives by engaging\nconsumers and delivering value to them. The marketing mix constitutes the company’s\ntactical tool kit for establishing strong positioning in target markets.</p>\n<p>Some critics think that the four Ps may omit or underemphasize certain important\nactivities. For example, they ask, “Where are services? Just because they don’t start with a\nP doesn’t justify omitting them.” The answer is that services, such as banking, airline, and\nretailing services, are products too. We might call them service products. “Where is packaging?”\nthe critics might ask. Marketers would answer that they include packaging as one of\nmany product decisions. All said, many marketing activities that\nmight appear to be left out of the marketing mix are included under one of the four Ps. The\nissue is not whether there should be four, six, or ten Ps so much as what framework is most\nhelpful in designing integrated marketing programs.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen your target market, you need to develop strategies for product, price, place, and promotion. Product strategies refer to brand name, package image, guarantees and similar. When it comes to pricing, you need to deliver the best value at the lowest possible cost. Distribution strategies concern activities such as warehousing and shipping. Finally, promotion is how marketers communicate about their products. However, some of these strategies may change from state to state. Therefore, it is very important for international businesses to do research on the new market.</p>\n<h3 id="the-evolution-of-marketing"><a href="#the-evolution-of-marketing" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>The Evolution of Marketing</h3>\n<p><strong>Production era</strong> In the early 1900s, companies did not focus on customers. The priority was to produce large quantities of goods as soon as possible. One of the most popular businessmen at the time, Henry Ford, said: “You can have your Model T in any colour you want as long as it’s black.”</p>\n<p><strong>Selling era</strong> Selling era emerged in 1930s and 1940s during the Depression and World Word II when producers faced the problem in the market of having <strong>supply greater than demand</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing era</strong> This era emerged after the WWII, when companies strived to fulfil <strong>customers’ needs</strong>. There are various reasons for this focus, the most dominant being transformation of military supplies to consumer production and return of people from the war.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationship era</strong> It refers to the concept of <strong>retaining your current costumers</strong> and persuading them to spend more money on your products. It is suggested that getting a new costumer can cost five times more than retaining an existing one.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/marketing",title:"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections",order:10}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{order:0,path:"/intro",title:"Introduction to the Course"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:1,path:"/change",title:"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:2,path:"/economic",title:"Assessing Economic Conditions"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:3,path:"/marketplace",title:"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:4,path:"/ethics",title:"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:5,path:"/communication",title:"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:6,path:"/business-formation",title:"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:7,path:"/midterm",title:"Midterm exam"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:8,path:"/entrepreneurship",title:"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel"
