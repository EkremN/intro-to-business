Services: A Product by Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>If a “product” includes anything that satisfies consumer\nneeds, services clearly fit the bill. But services have some\nobvious differences from tangible goods. You often cannot\nsee, hear, smell, taste, or touch a service, and you can virtually\nnever “own” it. After math tutoring, for example, you\nmight possess sharper algebra skills, but you don’t own\nthe tutoring experience (at least not literally). Most services\nembody these qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Intangibility:</strong> You typically cannot see, smell, taste, or\ntouch a service before you buy it. Clearly, this creates\na lot of uncertainty. Will the purchase really be worthwhile?\nSmart marketers mitigate the uncertainty by\ngiving clues that suggest value. For example, the\nFormosa Café, a funky, old-time Hollywood bar and restaurant,\nplasters the walls with signed pictures of movie stars, providing “evidence” of its movie biz credentials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inseparability:</strong> Try as you might, you simply can’t\nseparate the buyer of a service from the person who\nrenders it. Delivery requires interaction between the\nbuyer and the provider, and the customer directly\ncontributes to the quality of the service. Consider\na trip to the doctor. If you accurately describe your\nsymptoms, you’re likely to get a correct diagnosis.\nBut if you simply say, “I just don’t feel normal,” the\noutcome will likely be different.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Variability:</strong> This one ties closely to inseparability. A\ntalented massage therapist would probably help you\nrelax, whereas a mediocre one might actually create\ntension. And even the talented massage therapist\nmight give better service at the end of the day than\nat the beginning, or worse service on the day she\nbreaks up with her boyfriend. Variability also applies\nto the difference among providers. A massage at a\ntop-notch spa is likely to be better than a massage at\nyour local gym.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Perishability:</strong> Marketers cannot store services for\ndelivery at peak periods. A restaurant, for instance,\nonly has so many seats; they can’t (reasonably) tell their 8 p.m. dinner customers to come back the next\nday at 5 p.m. Similarly, major tourist destinations, such\nas Las Vegas, can’t store an inventory of room service\ndeliveries or performances of Cirque du Soleil. This\ncreates obvious cost issues; is it worthwhile to prepare\nfor a peak crowd but lose money when it’s slow? The\nanswer depends on the economics of your business.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="11-goods-versus-services-a-mixed-bag"><a href="#11-goods-versus-services-a-mixed-bag" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>1.1 Goods versus Services: A Mixed Bag</h3>\n<p>Identifying whether a product is a good or a service\ncan pose a considerable challenge, since many products\ncontain elements of both. A meal at your local\nItalian restaurant obviously includes tangible goods: you\ndefinitely own that calzone. But someone else took your\norder, brought it to the table, and (perhaps most importantly)\ndid the dishes! Service was clearly a crucial part of\nthe package.\nA goods and services spectrum can provide a valuable\ntool for analyzing the relationship between the two. At one extreme, <strong>pure goods</strong> don’t include\nany services. Examples include a bottle of ketchup\nor a package of socks. At the other extreme, <strong>pure services</strong>\ndon’t include any goods. Examples include financial\nconsulting or a piano lesson.

Understanding\nthese layers is valuable, since the most successful products\ndelight consumers at each one of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Benefit</strong> At the most fundamental level, consumers\nbuy a core benefit that satisfies their needs.

Consumer\nproducts are purchased\nfor personal use or consumption,\nwhile business\nproducts\nare purchased to use either\ndirectly or indirectly in the\nproduction of another\nproduct.

Product Differentiation and Planning: A Meaningful Difference</h2>\n<p>While some products have succeeded with little or no\nforethought, you’ll dramatically boost your chance of a\nhit with careful planning. Product differentiation\nshould be a key consideration. Winning products must\nembody a real or perceived difference versus the glut of\ngoods and services that compete in virtually every corner\nof the market. But different alone isn’t enough; different\nfrom, and better than, the competition are both critical in\norder to create the shortest path to success.</p>\n<p>Product quality relates directly to product value, which\ncomes from understanding your customer. Peter Drucker,\na noted business thinker, writer, and educator, declared:</p>\n<p><em>Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier\nputs in. It’s what the customer gets out and is willing to\npay for. A product is not quality because it is hard to make\nand costs a lot of money . . . this is incompetence. Customers\npay only for what is of use to them and gives them\nvalue. Nothing else constitutes quality.</em></p>\n<p>In other words, a high-quality product does a great\njob meeting customer needs. Siemens, a huge electronics\nconglomerate, embodies this thinking in its approach\nto quality: “Quality is when our customers come back and\nour products don’t.”</p>\n<p>But the specific definition of quality—and the attributes\nthat indicate quality—changes across product categories.\n<strong>Quality level</strong> refers to how well a product\nperforms its core functions. You\nmight think that smart companies\ndeliver the highest possible\nlevel of performance, but this is\nseldom profitable, or even desirable.</p>\n<p>For instance, only a tiny group\nof consumers would pay for a speedboat to go 200 mph, when 80 mph offers a sufficient\nthrill (at least for most of us!). The right level of\nproduct performance is the level that meets the needs\nof your consumers, and those needs include price. Decisions\nabout quality level must also consider the competition.\nThe goal is to outperform the other players in\nyour category while maintaining profitability.</p>\n<p>The second dimension of quality is <strong>product\nconsistency</strong>. How consistently does your product actually\ndeliver the promised level of quality? With a positive relationship\nbetween price and performance, consistent delivery\ncan offer a competitive edge at almost any quality level.\nHonda offers an excellent example. When most people\nconsider the Accord, the Civic, and the CRV, all Hondaowned\nmodels, quality quickly comes to mind. And all\nthree dominate their markets. But clearly, the quality levels\n(and price) are different for each. The Accord serves the upper,\nmore conservative end of the market; the Civic tends\nto appeal to younger, hipper, more budget-minded consumers;\nthe CRV tends to appeal to middle-of-the-road\nshoppers seeking a reliable, small SUV. In short, Honda succeeds\nat delivering product consistency at several markedly\ndifferent quality levels.</p>\n<h3 id="21-branding"><a href="#21-branding" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>2.1. Branding</h3>\n<p>At the most basic level, a <strong>brand</strong> is a product’s identity that\nsets it apart from other players in the same category. Typically,\nbrands represent the combination of elements such\nas product name, symbol, design, reputation, and image.\nBut today’s most powerful emerging brands go far beyond\nthe sum of their attributes. They project a compelling\ngroup identity that creates brand fanatics: loyal customers\nwho advocate for the brand better than any advertising\na marketer could buy. The overall value of a brand to an\norganization—\nthe extra money that consumers will spend\nto buy that brand—is called <strong>brand equity</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Brand Name</strong> A catchy, memorable name is among the\nmost powerful elements of your brand. While the right\nname will never save\na bad business, it can\nlaunch a good business\nto new heights. But finding\nthe right name can\nbe tough. According to\nthe respected Brighter\nNaming consulting\ngroup, the following\ncharacteristics can help:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Short, sweet, and\neasy to pronounce\nand spell: Examples\ninclude Sprite, H&#x26;M,\nGE, Nike, and Visa.</li>\n<li>Unique within the industry: Think Caterpillar, Yahoo!,\nStarbucks, Zara, and Google.</li>\n<li>Good alliteration, especially for long names: The words\nshould roll off your tongue. Some examples are Coca-Cola,\nBlackBerry, Dunkin Donuts, Weight Watchers, and\nMinute Maid.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id="3-innovation-and-the-product-life-cycle-nuts-bolts-and-a-spar-k-of-brilliance"><a href="#3-innovation-and-the-product-life-cycle-nuts-bolts-and-a-spar-k-of-brilliance" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>3. Innovation and the Product Life Cycle: Nuts, Bolts, and a Spar k of Brilliance</h2>\n<p>For a business to thrive long term, effective new product\ndevelopment is vital. And the process works only if it happens\nquickly. As technological advances hit the market at\nbreakneck speed, current products are becoming obsolete\nfaster than ever before. The need for speed compounds as\nhungry competitors crowd every niche of the market. But\nthe rush is risky, since new product development costs\ncan be in the millions, and the success rate is less than a\nthird. Marketers who succeed in this challenging arena devote\npainstaking effort to understanding their customers,\nbut they also nurture the creativity they need to generate new ideas. An example of how this can work: The 3M\nCorporation—makers of Post-It Notes and Scotch Tape—\nintroduces about 500 new products per year by pushing its\nemployees to “relentlessly ask, ‘What if?’” Some innovative\nfirms, such as Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, also encourage\nworkers to spend 20% of their work time (paid work\ntime!) on projects of personal interest.</p>\n<h3 id="31-types-of-innovation"><a href="#31-types-of-innovation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>3.1.

Levels of innovation fall along a spectrum,\nas shown in Exhibit 12.6.\n<strong>Discontinuous Innovations</strong> - are brand-new ideas that radically change how people live.\nExamples include the first car, the first television, and the first\ncomputer. These dramatic innovations require extensive customer\nlearning, which should guide the marketing process.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamically Continuous</strong> continuous innovations are characterized by marked changes to existing products. Examples include cell phones, Blu-ray discs, and digital cameras. These types of\ninnovations require a moderate level of consumer learning\nin exchange for significant benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous Innovation</strong> A slight modification of an\nexisting product is called a continuous innovation. Examples\ninclude new sizes, flavors, shapes, packaging, and design.\nThe goal of continuous innovation is to distinguish\na product from the competition. The goal of a knockoff is\nsimply to copy a competitor and offer a lower price.</p>\n<h3 id="32-the-new-product-development-process"><a href="#32-the-new-product-development-process" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>3.2. The New Product Development Process</h3>\n<p>An efficient, focused development process will boost your\nchances of new product success. The standard model includes six stages:</p>\n<p><strong>Idea Generation:</strong> Some experts estimate that it\ntakes 50 ideas for each new product that makes it to\nmarket, so you should definitely cast a wide net. Ideas\ncan come from almost anywhere, including customer\nresearch, customer complaints, salespeople, engineers,\nsuppliers, and competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea Screening:</strong> The purpose of this stage is to\nweed out ideas that don’t fit with the company’s\nobjectives and ideas that would clearly be too\nexpensive to develop. The Walt Disney Company,\nfor instance, would certainly\neliminate the idea of an XXX\ncable channel because it just\ndoesn’t fit their mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The purpose of the\nanalysis stage is to estimate\ncosts and forecast sales for each idea to get a sense of the potential profit and\nof how the product might fit within the company’s\nresources.\nEach idea must meet rigorous standards\nto remain a contender.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> The development process leads to\ndetailed descriptions of each concept with specific\nproduct features. New product teams sometimes also\nmake prototypes, or samples, that consumers can\nactually test. The results help fully refine the concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing:</strong> This stage involves the formal process of\nsoliciting feedback from consumers by testing the\nproduct concept. Do they like the features? Are\nthe benefits meaningful? What price makes sense?\nSome companies also test-market their products or\nsell them in a limited area to evaluate the consumer\nresponse.</p>\n<p><strong>Commercialization:</strong> This stage entails introducing\nthe product to the general market. Two key success\nfactors are gaining distribution and launching\npromotions. But a product that tested well doesn’t\nalways mean instant success. The VW Beetle, for\nexample, sold only 330 cars during its first year in the\nUnited States, but it later became a hit.</p>\n<h3 id="33-the-product-life-cycle-maximizing-results-over-time"><a href="#33-the-product-life-cycle-maximizing-results-over-time" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>3.3. The Product Life Cycle: Maximizing Results over Time**</h3>\n<p>When marketers introduce a new product, they hope it\nwill last forever, generating sales and profits for years to\ncome. But they also realize that all products go through\na product\nlife cycle: a pattern of sales and profits that\ntypically\nchanges over time. The life cycle can be dramatically\ndifferent across individual products and product categories,\nand predicting the exact shape and length of the\nlife cycle is virtually impossible. But most product categories\ndo move through the four distinct stages</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-8a2c7.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 55.06816834617664%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="business life cycle.JPG"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-b80fa.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-cf410.jpg 163w,\n/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-62f2a.jpg 325w,\n/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-b80fa.jpg 650w,\n/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-08cb4.jpg 975w,\n/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\n/static/business_life_cycle-323e296b6676cacfd29471712c2b077f-8a2c7.jpg 1687w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This is a time of low sales and\nnonexistent profits as companies invest in raising\nawareness about the product and the product\ncategory. Some categories, such as the microwave,\nlanguish in this phase for years, while other categories,\nsuch as computer memory sticks, zoom through\nthis phase. And some categories never get beyond\nintroduction. (Think clear beers.)</p>\n<p><strong>Growth:</strong> During the growth period, sales continue\nto rise, although profits usually peak. Typically, competitors\nbegin to notice emerging categories in the\ngrowth phase. They enter the market—often with\nnew variations of existing products—\nwhich further\nfuels the growth. Electric cars and plug-in hybrids\nare currently in the growth phase, and a number of\ncompetitors have recently entered the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Maturity:</strong> During maturity, sales usually peak. Profits\ncontinue to decline as competition intensifies. Once a\nmarket is mature, the only way to gain more users is to\nsteal them from competitors, rather than to bring new\nusers into the category. Weaker players begin to drop out\nof the category. Gasoline-powered cars, sugared soda,\nand network TV are in maturity in the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Decline:</strong> During this period, sales and profits begin\nto decline, sometimes quite rapidly. The reasons usually\nrelate to either technological change or change\nin consumer needs. For instance, the introduction\nof word processing pushed typewriters into decline,\nand a change in consumer taste and habits pushed\nhot cereal into decline. Competitors continue to drop\nout of the category.</p>\n<p>Familiarity with the product life cycle helps marketers\nplan effective strategies for existing products and identify\nprofitable categories for new products. Exhibit 12.8 summarizes\ntypical marketing strategies and offers examples\nfor each phase.\nIndividual products also have life cycles that usually\nfollow the category growth pattern but sometimes vary\ndramatically. Clearly, it’s in the marketer’s best interest to extend the profitable run of an individual brand as long as\npossible. There are several ways to make this happen: finding\nnew uses for the product, changing the product, and\nchanging the marketing mix. For example, Dancing with\nthe Stars renews interest in their franchise by continually\nintroducing new celebrity contestants.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/product-promotion",title:"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value",order:11}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{order:0,path:"/intro",title:"Introduction to the Course"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:1,path:"/change",title:"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:2,path:"/economic",title:"Assessing Economic Conditions"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:3,path:"/marketplace",title:"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:4,path:"/ethics",title:"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:5,path:"/communication",title:"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:6,path:"/business-formation",title:"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:7,path:"/midterm",title:"Midterm exam"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:8,path:"/entrepreneurship",title:"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:9,path:"/accounting",title:"Accounting: Decision Making by the Numbers"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:10,path:"/marketing",title:"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:11,path:"/product-promotion",title:"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:14,path:"/management-motivation-leadership",title:"Management, Motivation, and Leadership: Bringing Business to Life"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:17,path:"/final-exam",title:"Final Exam"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:17,path:"/presentations",title:"Business Plan Presentation"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:17,path:"/amazon",title:"Case Study Amazon.com"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{order:17,path:"/why",title:" Case Study Start with Why"}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
