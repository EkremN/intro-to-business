In late 2015, China’s economic growth rate dropped below 7% for the first time since 2009, and the government set the country’s 2016 growth target at 16.5%. While still enviable for most other countries, this represents China’s slowest rate of growth in 25 years. Compounding problems, China’s stock market collapsed in January 2016, wiping out more than $1.1 trillion in market value in just one week. While China’s long-term growth engine seems to be sputtering, many economists believe that the country will eventually regain momentum and will remain a powerful player in the global economy. </p>\n<iframe width="800" height="370" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJLpGiHhr8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Brazil and Russia, on the other hand, have actually been experiencing negative economic growth. Some 16% of young Brazilians are unemployed, boding poorly for the country’s future. India remains the lone bright spot among the BRIC countries. Still, despite its ongoing economic strength, India must address important issues such as infrastructure investment and regulatory reforms to maintain its robust growth. So with the BRIC countries playing less of a role than expected, which areas are currently emerging in today’s global marketplace? Most experts seem to see a pattern of emergence in Southeast Asia and Africa. Vietnam, the Philippines, and Bangladesh are all benefitting from the migration of labor-intensive, low-wage manufacturing jobs away from China. As more jobs are created, these locations will likely begin to develop sturdy middle classes and stabilized economies. A number of sub-Saharan African nations, such as Nigeria, Kenya, and Angola, also represent an enormous opportunity for economic growth. According to a Standard Bank of Africa report, in the 11 countries that represent 50% of Africa’s GDP, there are 15 million households in the middle class. The Standard Bank of Africa predicts that this number will grow to 42 million by 2030.</p>\n<p>This kind of prediction has spurred gigantic firms such as Kellogg’s, Procter &#x26; Gamble, and Walmart to capitalize on the opportunity and make multimillion-dollar investments in Africa. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the opportunity comes hand in hand with massive challenges. Many African countries are rife with security risks, political instability, and flat-out civil war. Africa also faces seemingly intractable infrastructure problems, including insufficient access to fresh water and electricity. A silver lining, however, is that solving these infrastructure issues could itself be a new opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs.</p>\n<h2 id="key-reasons-for-international-trade"><a href="#key-reasons-for-international-trade" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Key Reasons for International Trade</h2>\n<p>Companies engage in global trade for a range of reasons beyond the obvious opportunity to tap into huge and growing new markets. The benefits include better access to factors of production, reduced risk, and an inflow of new ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to factors of production:</strong> International trade offers a valuable opportunity for individual firms to capitalize on factors of production that simply aren’t present in the right amount for the right price in each individual country. India, China, and the Philippines, for example, attract multibillion-dollar investments because of their large cohort of technically skilled university graduates who work for about one-fifth the pay of comparable American workers. Russia and the OPEC nations offer a rich supply of oil, and Canada, like other forested nations, boasts an abundant supply of timber. The United States offers plentiful capital, which is less available in other parts of the world. International trade helps even out some of the resource imbalances among nations.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduced risk:</strong> Global trade reduces dependence on one economy, lowering the economic risk for multinational firms. When the Japanese economy entered a deep, sustained slump in the 1990s, for instance, Sony and Toyota thrived through their focus on other, healthier markets around the world. But a word of caution is key: As national economies continue to integrate, an economic meltdown in one part of the world can have far - reaching impact. Major foreign banks, for example, were badly burned by the U.S. subprime market mess, due to heavy investments in U.S. mortgage markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Inflow of innovation:</strong> International trade can also offer companies an invaluable source of <strong>new ideas</strong>. Japan, for instance, is far ahead of the curve regarding cell phone service. Japanese cell phone “extras,” including games, ringtones, videos, and stylish new accessories, set the standard for cell service around the world. In Europe, meanwhile, consumers are showing a growing interest in traditional and regional foods, which allow them to picture where their ingredients come from. Companies with a presence in foreign markets experience budding trends like these firsthand, giving them a jump in other markets around the world</p>\n<h3 id="competitive-advantage"><a href="#competitive-advantage" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Competitive Advantage</h3>\n<p>Beyond individual companies, industries tend to succeed on a worldwide basis in countries that enjoy a competitive advantage. But to understand competitive advantage, you need to first understand how opportunity cost relates to international trade. When a country produces more of one good, it must produce less of another good (assuming that resources are finite). The value of the second-best choice — the value of the production that a country gives up in order to produce the first product — represents the opportunity cost of producing the first product. A country has an absolute advantage when it can produce more of a good than other nations, using the same amount of resources. China, for example, has an absolute advantage in terms of <strong>clothing production</strong>, relative to the United States. But having an absolute advantage isn’t always enough. Unless they face major trade barriers, the industries in any country tend to produce products for which they have a comparative advantage — meaning that they tend to turn out those goods that have the lowest opportunity cost compared to other countries. The United States, for instance, boasts a comparative advantage versus most countries in movie and television program production; <strong>Germany has a comparative advantage in the production of high - performance cars</strong>; and South Korea enjoys a comparative advantage in electronics. But keep in mind that comparative advantage seldom remains static. As technology changes and the workforce evolves (through factors such as education and experience), nations may gain or lose comparative advantage in various industries. China and India, for example, are both seeking to build a comparative advantage versus other nations in technology production by investing in their infrastructure and their institutions of higher education.</p>\n<h2 id="balance-of-trade"><a href="#balance-of-trade" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Balance of Trade</h2>\n<p>The balance of trade is a basic measure of the difference between a nation’s exports and imports. If the total value of exports is higher than the total value of imports, the country has a trade surplus. If the total value of imports is higher than the total value of exports, the country has a trade deficit. Balance of trade includes the value of both goods and services, and it incorporates trade with all foreign nations. Although a trade deficit signals the wealth of an economy that can afford to buy huge amounts of foreign products, a large deficit can be destabilizing. It indicates, after all, that as goods and services flow into a nation, money flows out — a challenge with regard to long-term economic health.</p>\n<h3 id="balance-of-payments"><a href="#balance-of-payments" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Balance of Payments</h3>\n<p>Balance of payments is a measure of the total flow of money into or out of a country. Clearly, the balance of trade plays a central role in determining the balance of payments. But the balance of payments also includes other financial flows such as foreign borrowing and lending, foreign aid payments and receipts, and foreign investments. A balance of payments surplus means that more money flows in than out, while a balance of payments deficit means that more money flows out than in. Keep in mind that the balance of payments typically corresponds to the balance of trade because trade is, in general, the largest component.</p>\n<h3 id="exchange-rates"><a href="#exchange-rates" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Exchange Rates</h3>\n<p>Exchange rates measure the value of one nation’s currency relative to the currency of other nations.

A surprisingly large chunk of international commerce— possibly as much as 25%—involves the barter of products for products rather than for currency.

Individual countertrade agreements range from simple barter to a complex web of exchanges that end up meeting the needs of multiple parties. Done poorly, countertrading can be a confusing nightmare for everyone involved. But done well, countertrading is a powerful tool for gaining customers and products that would not otherwise be available. Not surprisingly, barter opportunities tend to increase during economic downturns.

In fact, the opportunity may not even make sense for every firm. While international trade can offer new profit streams and lower costs, it also introduces a higher level of risk and complexity to running a business. Being ready to take on the challenge can mean the difference between success and failure. Firms ready to tap the opportunity have a number of options for how to move forward. One way is to seek foreign suppliers through outsourcing and importing. Another possibility is to seek foreign customers through <strong>exporting</strong>, <strong>licensing</strong>, <strong>franchising</strong>, and <strong>direct investment</strong>. These market development options fall in a spectrum from\nlow cost–low control to high cost–high control in other words, companies that choose to export products to a foreign country spend less to enter that market than companies that choose to build their own factories. But companies that build their own factories have a lot more control than exporters over how their business unfolds. Keep in mind that profit opportunity and risk—which vary along with cost and control — also play a critical role in how firms approach international markets. Smaller firms tend to begin with exporting and move along the spectrum as the business develops. But larger firms may jump straight to the strategies that give them more control over their operations. Large firms are also likely to use a number of different approaches in different countries, depending on the goals of the firm and the structure of the foreign market. Regardless of the specific strategy, most large companies — such as General Electric, Nike, and Disney—both outsource with foreign suppliers and sell their products to foreign markets.</p>\n<h3 id="foreign-outsourcing-and-importing"><a href="#foreign-outsourcing-and-importing" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Foreign Outsourcing and Importing</h3>\n<p>Foreign outsourcing means contracting with foreign suppliers to produce products, usually at a fraction of the cost of domestic production. </p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong> </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-9124f.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 56.3%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="H&M"\n        title=""\n        src="/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-b80fa.jpg"\n        srcset="/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-cf410.jpg 163w,\n/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-62f2a.jpg 325w,\n/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-b80fa.jpg 650w,\n/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-08cb4.jpg 975w,\n/introduction-to-business/static/HM-9d0729ac036e2e4fd723c4fc1ffd5b05-9124f.jpg 1000w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>H&#x26;M</strong>, for instance, relies on a network for manufacturers around the globe, mostly in less developed parts of the world, including Kenya, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. <strong>Apple</strong> depends on firms in China and Taiwan to produce the iPhone. And countless small companies contract with foreign manufacturers as well. The key benefit, of course, is dramatically lower wages, which drive down the cost of production.</p>\n<p>While foreign outsourcing lowers costs, it also involves significant risk. Quality control typically requires very detailed specifications to ensure that a company gets what it actually needs. Another key risk of foreign outsourcing involves <strong>social responsibility</strong>. A firm that contracts with foreign producers has an obligation to ensure that those factories adhere to ethical standards. Deciding what those standards should be is often quite tricky, given different cultures, expectations, and laws in different countries. And policing the factories on an ongoing basis can be even harder than determining the standards. But companies that don’t get it right face the threat of significant consumer backlash in the United States and Europe. </p>\n<!-- \nThis has been a particular issue with products produced in China. In the recent past, for instance, product defects forced U.S. firms to recall a host of Chinese produced toys, including Thomas the Tank Engine trains that were coated with toxic lead paint, ghoulish fake eyeballs that were filled with kerosene, and Polly Pocket dolls that posed a swallowing hazard. And in 2013, Greenpeace released a study that showed that the bulk of children’s clothing produced in China — the world’s largest exporter of textiles — contains hazardous levels of toxic chemicals. Many Americans have become personally familiar with the quality/cost tradeoff as a growing number of companies have outsourced customer service to foreign call centers. Research suggests that the approximate cost of offering a live, American-based, customer service agent averages about $7.50 per call, while outsourcing those calls to live agents in another country drops the average cost down to about $3.25 per call. But customers end up paying the difference in terms of satisfaction, reporting high levels of misunderstanding, frustration, and inefficiency. A number of firms — such as jetBlue and Amazon.com — have enjoyed the best of both worlds by outsourcing customer service calls to U.S. agents who work from their own homes.  -->\n<p><strong>Importing</strong> means buying products from overseas that have already been produced, rather than contracting with overseas manufacturers to produce special orders. Imported products, of course, don’t carry the brand name of the importer, but they also don’t carry as much risk. Pier 1 Imports, a large retail chain, has built a powerful brand around the importing concept, creating stores that give the customer the sense of a global shopping trip without the cost or hassle of actually leaving the country.</p>\n<h3 id="exporting"><a href="#exporting" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Exporting</h3>\n<p><strong>Exporting</strong> is the most basic level of international market development. It simply means producing products domestically and selling them abroad. Exporting represents an especially strong opportunity for small and mid-sized companies. In Tennessee, for instance, Heritage Glass, a small firm that has manufactured glass since the Civil War, plans to reopen a factory that was shuttered for two years, to capitalize on strong demand for patterned glass from the Philippines, Europe, and South America.</p>\n<h3 id="foreign-licensing-and-foreign-franchising"><a href="#foreign-licensing-and-foreign-franchising" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Foreign Licensing and Foreign Franchising</h3>\n<p>Foreign licensing and foreign franchising, the next level of commitment to international markets, are quite similar. <strong>Foreign licensing</strong> involves a domestic firm granting a foreign firm the rights to produce and market its product or to use its trademark/patent rights in a defined geographical area. The company that offers the rights, or the licensor, receives a fee from the company that buys the rights, or the licensee. This approach allows firms to expand into foreign markets with <em>little or no investment</em>, and it also helps circumvent government restrictions on importing in closed markets. But <strong>maintaining control of licensees</strong> can be a significant challenge. Licensors also run the risk that unethical licensees may become their <strong>competitors</strong>, using information that they gained from the licensing agreement. Foreign licensing is especially common in the food and beverage industry. The most high-profile examples include Coke and Pepsi, which grant licenses to foreign bottlers all over the world. Foreign franchising is a specialized type of licensing. A firm that expands through foreign <strong>franchising</strong>, called a <strong>franchisor</strong>, offers other businesses, or <strong>franchisees</strong>, the right to produce and market its products if the franchisee agrees to specific operating requirements — a complete package of how to do business. Franchisors also often offer their franchisees management guidance, marketing support, and even financing. In return, franchisees pay both a start-up fee and an ongoing percentage of sales to the franchisor. <strong>One key difference between franchising and licensing is that franchisees assume the identity of the franchisor</strong>. A McDonald’s franchise in Paris, for instance, is clearly a McDonald’s, not, say, a Pierre’s Baguette outlet that also carries McDonald’s products.</p>\n<h3 id="foreign-direct-investment"><a href="#foreign-direct-investment" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Foreign Direct Investment</h3>\n<p>Direct investment in foreign production and marketing facilities represents the deepest level of global involvement. The\ncost is high, but companies with direct investments have more control over how their business operates in a given country. The high-dollar commitment also represents significant risk if the business doesn’t go well. Most direct investment takes the form of either acquiring foreign firms or developing new facilities from the ground up. Another increasingly popular approach is strategic alliances or partnerships that allow multiple firms to share risks and resources for mutual benefit. Foreign acquisitions enable companies to gain a foothold quickly in new markets. </p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>\nIn 2009, for example, Italian carmaker Fiat took over struggling U.S. auto giant Chrysler, with plans to more fully exploit the American market in the wake of the Great Recession. A number of other global giants, such as Microsoft, General Electric, and Nestlé, tend to follow a foreign acquisition strategy. Developing new facilities from scratch — or “offshoring” — is the most costly form of direct investment. It also involves significant risk. But the benefits include complete control over how the facility develops and the potential for high profits, which makes the approach attractive for corporations that can afford it. Intel, for instance, built a $2.5 billion specialized computer chip manufacturing plant in northeastern China. And foreign car companies, from German Daimler-Benz, to Korean Hyundai, to Japanese Toyota, have built factories in the southern United States. </p>\n<p><strong>Joint ventures</strong> involve two or more companies joining forces — sharing resources, risks, and profits, but not merging companies — to pursue specific opportunities. A formal, long - term agreement is usually called a partnership, while a less formal, less encompassing agreement is usually called a strategic alliance. Joint ventures are a popular, though controversial, means of entering foreign markets. Often a foreign company connects with a local firm to ease its way into the market. In fact, some countries, such as India and Malaysia, require that foreign investors have local partners. But research from Harvard finance professor Mihir Desai finds that joint ventures between multinational firms and domestic partners can be more costly and less rewarding than they initially appear. He and his team suggest that they make sense only in countries that require local political and cultural knowledge as a core element of doing business.</p>\n<h2 id="barriers-to-international-trade"><a href="#barriers-to-international-trade" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Barriers to International Trade</h2>\n<p>Every business faces challenges, but international firms face more hurdles than domestic firms. Understanding and surmounting those hurdles is the key to success in global markets. Most barriers to trade fall into the following categories: <strong>sociocultural differences</strong>, <strong>economic differences</strong>, and <strong>legal/political differences</strong>. As you think about these barriers, keep in mind that each country has a different mix of barriers. Often countries with the highest barriers have the least competition, which can be a real opportunity for the first international firms to break through.</p>\n<h3 id="sociocultural-differences"><a href="#sociocultural-differences" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Sociocultural Differences</h3>\n<p><strong>Sociocultural</strong> differences include differences among countries in language, attitudes, and values. Some specific, and perhaps surprising, elements that affect business include nonverbal communication, forms of address, attitudes toward punctuality, religious celebrations and customs, business practices, and expectations regarding meals and gifts. Understanding and responding to sociocultural factors are vital for firms that operate in multiple countries. But since the differences often operate at a subtle level, they can undermine relationships before anyone is aware that it’s happening. The best way to jump over sociocultural barriers is to conduct thorough consumer research, cultivate firsthand knowledge, and practice extreme sensitivity. The payoff can be a sharp competitive edge. Hyundai, for instance, enjoys a whopping 18% share of the passenger car market in India. It beats the competition with custom features that reflect Indian culture, such as elevated rooflines to provide more headroom for turban - wearing motorists.</p>\n<h3 id="economic-differences"><a href="#economic-differences" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Economic Differences</h3>\n<p>Before entering a foreign market, it’s critical to understand and evaluate the <strong>local economic conditions</strong>. Key factors to consider include population, per capita income, economic growth rate, currency exchange rate, and stage of economic development. But keep in mind that low scores for any of these measures don’t necessarily equal a lack of opportunity. In fact, some of today’s biggest opportunities are in countries with low per capita income. For example, the Indian division of global giant Unilever gets 50% of its sales from rural India by selling products to individual consumers in tiny quantities, such as two-cent sachets of shampoo. Samsung has introduced Guru, a mobile phone that can be charged with solar power, to rural India. Other mobile companies are scrambling to keep up. Effectively serving less - developed markets requires <strong>innovation and efficiency</strong>. Emerging consumers often need different product features, and they almost always need lower costs. C. K. Prahalad, an influential business scholar, believed that forward-thinking companies can make a profit in developing countries if they make advanced technology affordable. Many markets are simply so large that high-volume sales can make up for low profit margins. Overall, the profit potential is clear and growing. And as consumers in developing countries continue to gain income—although at a much slower pace in the wake of the economic crisis — companies that established their brands early will have a critical edge over firms that enter the market after them.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong> should be another key economic consideration when entering a foreign market. Infrastructure refers to a country’s physical facilities that support economic activity. It includes basic systems in each of the following\nareas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transportation (e.g., roads, airports, railroads, and ports)</li>\n<li>Communication (e.g., TV, radio, Internet, and cell phone coverage)</li>\n<li>Energy (e.g., utilities and power plants)</li>\n<li>Finance (e.g., banking, checking, and credit)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The level of infrastructure can vary dramatically among countries. In Africa, for instance, only 26.5% of the population has Internet access, compared to 87.7% in North America. In Vietnam and Thailand, many consumers buy products directly from vendors in small boats, compared to firmly grounded stores in Europe. Although credit card purchases are still relatively low in much of the world, particularly in Asia, recent growth has been explosive and will probably continue for the next few years.</p>\n<h3 id="political-and-legal-differences"><a href="#political-and-legal-differences" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Political and Legal Differences</h3>\n<p>Political regimes obviously differ around the world, and their policies have a dramatic impact on business. The specific laws and regulations that governments create around business are often less obvious, yet they can still represent a significant barrier to international trade. To compete effectively — and to reduce risk — managers must carefully evaluate these factors and make plans to respond to them both now and as they change. Laws and Regulations International businesses must comply with international legal standards, the laws of their own countries, and the laws of their host countries. This can be a real challenge, since many developing countries change business regulations with little notice and less publicity. The justice system can pose another key challenge, particularly with regard to legal enforcement of ownership and contract rights. Since 2003, the World Bank has published a “Doing Business” report that ranks the ease of doing business for small and medium - sized companies in 189 different countries. The 2015 “Doing Business” report showed that for the seventh year running, Singapore leads in the ease of doing business, followed by New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR China, Denmark, South Korea, Norway, and the United States. As an individual country, Tajikistan improved the most in the ease of doing business. Overall, the Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions continue to show a faster rate of improvement than any other regions according to “Doing Business” indicators. The “Doing Business” project examines the ease of doing business from ten different angles, including the ease of dealing with <strong>construction permits</strong>, <strong>paying taxes</strong>, and <strong>enforcing contracts</strong>. The key benefit of an effective legal system is that it reduces risk for both domestic and foreign businesses. <strong>Bribery</strong>, the payment of money for favorable treatment, and corruption, the solicitation of money for favorable treatment, are also major issues throughout the world. While bribery and corruption are technically illegal in virtually every major country, they are often accepted as a standard way of doing business. Regardless, U.S. corporations and American citizens are subject to prosecution by U.S. authorities for offering bribes in any nation.</p>\n<p>The <strong>political climate</strong> of any country deeply influences whether that nation is attractive to foreign business. Stability is crucial. A country subject to strife from civil war, riots, or other violence creates huge additional risk for foreign business. Yet, figuring out how to operate in an unstable environment, such as Russia, Bolivia, or the Middle East, can give early movers a real advantage. Grant Winterton, Coca-Cola’s regional manager for Russia, commented to Time magazine that “the politics do concern us.” But having snagged 50% of the $1.9 billion carbonated-soft-drink market, he concludes that “the opportunity far outweighs the risk.” Poor enforcement of <strong>intellectual property</strong> rights across international borders is another tough issue for business. The Business Software Alliance’s piracy-tracking study found that worldwide piracy rates hover at about 42%, with piracy rates in emerging markets towering over those in mature markets — 68% versus 24%. The total value of software theft hit a record $63.4 billion. The highest-piracy countries are Georgia, Zimbabwe, Moldova, and Libya, all 90% or higher. Somewhat ironically, business decision makers admit to pirating software more frequently than other computer users do.</p>\n<p><strong>International Trade Restrictions National</strong> governments also have the power to erect barriers to international business through a variety of international trade restrictions. The arguments for and against trade restrictions—also called <strong>protectionism</strong> — are summarized below. As you read, note that most economists find the reasons to eliminate trade restrictions much more compelling than the reasons to create them. Just as trade restrictions have a range of motivations, they can take a number of different forms. The most common trade restrictions are tariffs, quotas, voluntary export restraints, and embargoes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tariffs</strong> are taxes levied against imports. Governments tend to use protective tariffs either to shelter fledgling industries that couldn’t compete without help, or to shelter industries that are crucial to the domestic economy. In 2009, Egypt imposed tariffs on sugar and the United States levied new tariffs on Chinese goods—including mattress springs and electrodes—that it contended were being dumped on the market at below-cost prices.</li>\n<li><strong>Quotas</strong> are limitations on the amount of specific products that may be imported from certain countries during a given time period. Russia, for instance, has specific quotas for U.S. meat imports.</li>\n<li><strong>Voluntary export restraints (VERs)</strong> are limitations on the amount of specific products that one nation will export to another nation. Although the government of the exporting country typically imposes VERs, they usually do so out of fear that the importing country would impose even more onerous restrictions. As a result, VERs often aren’t as “voluntary” as the name suggests. The United States, for instance, insisted on VERs with Japanese auto exports in the early 1980s (which many economists believe ultimately precipitated the decline of the U.S. auto industry).</li>\n<li><strong>An embargo</strong> is a total ban on the international trade of a certain item, or a total halt in trade with a particular nation. The intention of most embargoes is to pressure the targeted country to change political policies or to protect national security. The U.S. embargo against trade with Cuba offers a high-profile example. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nontariff barriers tend to be fairly effective because complaints about them can be hard to prove and easy to counter.</p>\n<h2 id="free-trade-the-movement-gains-momentum"><a href="#free-trade-the-movement-gains-momentum" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Free Trade: The Movement Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most dramatic change in the world economy has been the global move toward <strong>free trade</strong> — the unrestricted movement of goods and services across international borders.

Established in 1948 by 23 nations, GATT has undergone a number of revisions. The most significant changes stemmed from the 1986–1994 Uruguay Round of negotiations, which took bold steps to slash average tariffs by about 30% and to reduce other trade barriers among the 125 nations that signed. The Uruguay Round also created the <strong>World Trade Organization</strong> (WTO), a permanent global institution to promote international trade and to settle international trade disputes. The WTO monitors provisions of the GATT agreements, promotes further reduction of trade barriers, and mediates disputes among members. The decisions of the WTO are binding, which means that all parties involved in disputes must comply to maintain good standing in the organization. Ministers of the WTO meet every two years to address current world trade issues. As the world economy has shifted toward services rather than goods, the emphasis of WTO meetings has followed suit. Controlling rampant piracy of intellectual property is a key concern for developed countries. For less-developed countries, one central issue is U.S. and European agricultural subsidies, which may unfairly distort agricultural prices worldwide. In fact, both the broader agenda and the individual decisions of the WTO have become increasingly controversial over the past ten years. Advocates for less-developed nations are deeply concerned that free trade clears the path for major multinational corporations to push local businesses into economic failure. A local food stand, for instance, probably won’t have the resources to compete with a global giant such as McDonald’s. If the food stand closes, the community has gained inexpensive hamburgers, but the entrepreneur has lost his livelihood, and the community has lost the local flavor that contributes to its unique culture. Other opponents of the WTO worry that the acceleration of global trade encourages developing countries to fight laws that protect the environment and workers’ rights, for fear of losing their low-cost advantage on the world market. The concerns have sparked significant protests during the past few meetings of the WTO ministers, and the outcry may well grow louder as developing nationsgain economic clout.</p>\n<h3 id="the-world-bank"><a href="#the-world-bank" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>The World Bank</h3>\n<p>Established in the aftermath of World War II, the World Bank is an international cooperative of 188 member countries, working together to reduce poverty in the developing world. The World Bank influences the global economy by providing financial and technical advice to the governments of developing countries for projects in a range of areas, including infrastructure, communications, health, and education. The financial assistance usually comes in the form of low-interest loans.

The basic mission of the IMF is to promote international economic cooperation and stable growth. Funding comes from the member nations, with the United States contributing more than twice as much as any other country. To achieve these goals, the IMF:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Supports stable exchange rates</li>\n<li>Facilitates a smooth system of international payments</li>\n<li>Encourages member nations to adopt sound economic policies</li>\n<li>Promotes international trade</li>\n<li>Lends money to member nations to address economic problems</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although all of its functions are important, the IMF is best known as a lender of last resort to nations in financial trouble. This policy has come under fire in the past few years. Critics accuse the IMF of encouraging poor countries to borrow more money than they can ever hope to repay, which actually cripples their economies over the long term, creating even deeper poverty. At the end of 2005, the IMF responded to its critics by implementing a historic debt relief program for poor countries. Under this program, which has since been expanded to include other agencies, the IMF and its partners have extended 100% debt forgiveness to 35 poor countries, erasing about $76 billion in debt. The managing director of the IMF pointed out that the canceled debt will allow these countries to increase spending in priority areas to reduce poverty and promote growth (although some experts worry that debt cancellation sets a troubling precedent for future lending). The result should be a higher standard of living for some of the poorest people in the world.</p>\n<h3 id="trading-blocs-and-common-markets"><a href="#trading-blocs-and-common-markets" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Trading Blocs and Common Markets</h3>\n<p>Another major development in the past decade is the emergence of regional trading blocs, or groups of countries that have reduced or even eliminated all tariffs, allowing the free flow of goods among the member nations. A common market goes even further than a trading bloc by attempting to harmonize all trading rules. The United States, Mexico, and Canada have formed the largest trading bloc in the world, and the 28 countries of the European Union have formed the largest common market. <strong>NAFTA The North American Free Trade Agreement</strong> (NAFTA) is the treaty that created the free-trading zone among the United States, Mexico, and Canada. </p>\n<p><strong>European Union</strong> Composed of 28 nations and more than half a billion people, and boasting a combined GDP of nearly $17 trillion, the European Union (EU) is the world’s largest common market. The overarching goal of the EU is to bolster Europe’s trade position and to increase its international political and economic power. To help make this happen, the EU has removed all trade restrictions among member nations and unified internal trade rules, allowing goods and people to move freely among EU countries. The EU has also created standardized policies for import and export between EU countries and the rest of the world, giving the member nations more clout as a bloc than each would have had on its own. Perhaps the EU’s most economically significant move was the introduction of a single currency, the euro, in 2002. Of the 15 EU members at the time, 12 adopted the euro (exceptions were the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark). The EU also affects the global economy with its leading-edge approach to environmental protection, quality production, and human rights. In 2010 and 2011, hobbled by overwhelming debt and slow growth, several of the weaker EU countries — most notably Greece—spiraled into economic crisis. Fearing a financial domino effect, due to the close ties among the nations, the economically stronger EU countries cobbled together several bailout packages. But many economists still fear that its weaker members could drag the EU overall into a deep, damaging recession, and that one or more countries could default on its debt, withdraw from using the euro as currency, or both, with devastating financial consequences for both the EU and the world economy. </p>\n<p>In mid-2016, the United Kingdom, which includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, held a referendum on whether to exit the European Union. After an intense and divisive campaign, the UK public voted to leave the EU in a very close vote. Dubbed <strong>Brexit</strong> (a combination of the words “British” and “exit”), the decision to leave was quite unexpected.31 Many political and economic analysts have voiced deep concerns about the impact that Brexit will have on the United Kingdom as well as the rest of the world—especially in light of London’s position as an international banking center. The initial vote is likely to be final, but the implementation of Brexit will not be immediate. There will be an initial two-year negotiation with the EU about the terms of withdrawal. This negotiation is unlikely to be favorable toward Britain, in part so that the EU can discourage other countries from withdrawing. The EU has leverage with regard to items such as terms of trade. So why did Britain want out? The two major issues at play were <strong>immigration</strong> and <strong>self-determination</strong>. Many British citizens, especially older and more rural populations in England, were concerned that the country’s unemployment and social services would be swamped under the weight of new immigrant arrivals as mandated by the EU. Many Brits were also concerned that that the country’s identity and direction would increasingly be determined by the EU, and become fused into a continental identity. The ultimate impact of the British exit will be unclear for months, and likely years, to come. The next several years in particular will be critical to the shape, size, and structure of the European economy.</p>',
