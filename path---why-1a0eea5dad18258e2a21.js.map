This is rooted in Biology (not psychology):\\nThe human brain is broken into 3 major components (which correspond with the Golden Circle). Our <strong>neocortex</strong> corresponds with the “WHAT” level of the circle. It is responsible for all our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections (“HOW &#x26; WHY”) make up our <strong>limbic</strong> brain: which is responsible for: feelings, (trust and loyalty, etc.), all human behavior, and all decision making. It has no capacity for language. Communicating from the outside in: people understand vast amounts of complicated information like facts and/or features, but communicating from the inside out will reach what controls behavior (and thus decision making) and then they can rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where “gut decisions” come from.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-e7201.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 54.794520547945204%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-94962.png 325w,\\n/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-10273.png 650w,\\n/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-e7201.png 730w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>If you don’t clearly know WHY you do what you do-how will you ever get people to respond to WHAT it is that you are asking them to do?

He was well funded with 50,000$ from the War Department, to figure out this flying machine. Money was not a problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and he was extremely good connected. He knew all the big minds of the day and he hired the best that money could find and the marked conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere. Everyone was supporting him. But how is it possible that we don't know about him.</p>\\n<p>Few hundred miles away in Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe fo success. They paid for their dream with the money that they have earned from the bicycle shop, no college education, and they were not receiving positive press coverage. So why did the Wright Brothers succeed? They were consumed with a passion. They were driven by a cause, a purpose, a belief. They believed that if they could succeed they would change the course of the world. Their team worked with them from their passion, whit their blood, sweat and tears. Langley wanted fame and fortune. His team worked for the paycheck.\\nWright brothers were crashing al least five time a day and eventually in 1903, they started flying and no one was there,press and all others they came few days later.</p>\\n<p>Prove that Langley was there for the wrong reason.\\nThe day the Wright Brothers succeeded, he quit. He could have said that is an amazing discovery guys, let use my connections, money and team to improve the discovery but he didn't.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-law-of-diffusion-of-innovation\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-law-of-diffusion-of-innovation\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Law of Diffusion of Innovation</h3>\\n<p>The population:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-81c21.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 34.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-81c21.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>2.5% - Innovators</li>\\n<li>13.5% - Early Adopters</li>\\n<li>34% - Early Majority</li>\\n<li>34% - Late Majority</li>\\n<li>16% - Laggards</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This law tells us that if you want mass-market acceptance of an idea you must gain at least market share of 15% to 18% and you hit the “tipping point.” The Innovators and Early Adopters are comfortable making that “gut decision” because they believe something.

They were extremely well founded and market conditions were fantastic. But TiVo failed. They have never made money. When they launched their product they were talking about what they had. They said: \\\"We have a product that poses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking. And the cynical majority said, \\\"We don't believe you. We dont need it, we don't like it, you are scaring us.</p>\\n<p>What if they had said, \\\"If you are the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, do we have a product for you? It paused live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc. <strong>People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.</strong> And what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-04739.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 35.35714285714286%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-04739.jpg 840w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Lets talk about successful example. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mal in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. How he did that? Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in Marica who suffered in a pre-civil right America. In fact, some of his ideas wre bad. But he had a gift. He didn't do around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. And people who believed what he believed, took his case and they made it their own. They were telling other people about that. Just like that 250,000 people showed up on the right place at the right time to hear him speak. Non of those people showed up for him, they were there for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for 8 hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It was not black versus white it was 25% of the audience white. His speech was not about \\\"I have a plan\\\" it was about \\\"I have a dream\\\". He was a real leader and he inspired. We as individuals and organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves. </p>\\n<p>This case study was taken from the Simon Sinek speech which you can find:</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"370\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/why\",\"title\":\" Case Study I Start with Why\",\"order\":18}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/change\",\"title\":\"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/economic\",\"title\":\"Assessing Economic Conditions\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/marketplace\",\"title\":\"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/ethics\",\"title\":\"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/communication\",\"title\":\"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/business-formation\",\"title\":\"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/midterm\",\"title\":\"Midterm exam\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/entrepreneurship\",\"title\":\"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/accounting\",\"title\":\"Accounting: Decision Making by the Numbers\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/finance\",\"title\":\"Finance: Acquiring and Using Funds to Maximize Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/marketing\",\"title\":\"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/product-and-promotion\",\"title\":\"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/ps\",\"title\":\"Distribution and Pricing: Product, Person, Place, Price\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/management-motivation-leadership\",\"title\":\"Management, Motivation, and Leadership: Bringing Business to Life\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/human-resource\",\"title\":\"Human Resource Management: Building a Top-Quality Workforce \"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/operations-management\",\"title\":\"Operations Management: Putting It All Together\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/presentations\",\"title\":\"Presentations\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/why\",\"title\":\" Case Study I Start with Why\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/amazon\",\"title\":\"Case Study II Amazon.com\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/alibaba\",\"title\":\"Alibaba.com\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---why-1a0eea5dad18258e2a21.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Think about company that inspire Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, SpaceX, Starbucks, Coca-Cola.

Why is that they seem to have something different?</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-3219f.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 6.446700507614213%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAABCAYAAADeko4lAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAV0lEQVQI1wXBuw5AMABAUf//E/7CZPEeDIIyMGhS6VDSiEci0uY6J9BaY61lGVvu60E0IUopkjiiSmOMMXz9wPs5pDlY9xO1HXjv6eVMPQ34TuCyApeX/G7bSGIN0V1NAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-94962.png 325w,\\n/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-10273.png 650w,\\n/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-2fc6f.png 975w,\\n/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-a8a2c.png 1300w,\\n/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-173d2.png 1950w,\\n/static/logos-06cdb93edec3fee5f457e12bfd05d2ca-3219f.png 1970w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Why are some people able to accomplish so much more than others (others, who appear to have access to better resources or who are in a better position to succeed)?</p>\\n<p>Why was it that Martin Luther King was the man who was able to lead the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960’s? </p>\\n<p>After all, there were other great orators and leaders during that time.</p>\\n<p>Why is it that the Wright Brothers were able to lead the way in the race for manned flight when\\nothers were better qualified, better funded and equipped to do so?</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/WrightBrothers-0e1be0c5c9ada9d8ab26fef9f3f7e888-6fef6.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 48.697916666666664%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/WrightBrothers-0e1be0c5c9ada9d8ab26fef9f3f7e888-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/WrightBrothers-0e1be0c5c9ada9d8ab26fef9f3f7e888-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/WrightBrothers-0e1be0c5c9ada9d8ab26fef9f3f7e888-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/WrightBrothers-0e1be0c5c9ada9d8ab26fef9f3f7e888-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/WrightBrothers-0e1be0c5c9ada9d8ab26fef9f3f7e888-6fef6.jpg 768w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>It turned out that all great companies people they have some things in common.

This is rooted in Biology (not psychology):\\nThe human brain is broken into 3 major components (which correspond with the Golden Circle). Our <strong>neocortex</strong> corresponds with the “WHAT” level of the circle. It is responsible for all our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections (“HOW &#x26; WHY”) make up our <strong>limbic</strong> brain: which is responsible for: feelings, (trust and loyalty, etc.), all human behavior, and all decision making. It has no capacity for language. Communicating from the outside in: people understand vast amounts of complicated information like facts and/or features, but communicating from the inside out will reach what controls behavior (and thus decision making) and then they can rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where “gut decisions” come from.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-e7201.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 54.794520547945204%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-94962.png 325w,\\n/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-10273.png 650w,\\n/static/Limbic-Brain-and-Neocortex-ecae27c4fb785609effad12c21d30db3-e7201.png 730w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>If you don’t clearly know WHY you do what you do-how will you ever get people to respond to WHAT it is that you are asking them to do?

He was well funded with 50,000$ from the War Department, to figure out this flying machine. Money was not a problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and he was extremely good connected. He knew all the big minds of the day and he hired the best that money could find and the marked conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere. Everyone was supporting him. But how is it possible that we don't know about him.</p>\\n<p>Few hundred miles away in Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe fo success. They paid for their dream with the money that they have earned from the bicycle shop, no college education, and they were not receiving positive press coverage. So why did the Wright Brothers succeed? They were consumed with a passion. They were driven by a cause, a purpose, a belief. They believed that if they could succeed they would change the course of the world. Their team worked with them from their passion, whit their blood, sweat and tears. Langley wanted fame and fortune. His team worked for the paycheck.\\nWright brothers were crashing al least five time a day and eventually in 1903, they started flying and no one was there,press and all others they came few days later.</p>\\n<p>Prove that Langley was there for the wrong reason.\\nThe day the Wright Brothers succeeded, he quit. He could have said that is an amazing discovery guys, let use my connections, money and team to improve the discovery but he didn't.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-law-of-diffusion-of-innovation\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-law-of-diffusion-of-innovation\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Law of Diffusion of Innovation</h3>\\n<p>The population:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-81c21.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 34.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/Content_The_Diffusion-79232debe0b778b58f5efa5b64dd960b-81c21.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>2.5% - Innovators</li>\\n<li>13.5% - Early Adopters</li>\\n<li>34% - Early Majority</li>\\n<li>34% - Late Majority</li>\\n<li>16% - Laggards</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This law tells us that if you want mass-market acceptance of an idea you must gain at least market share of 15% to 18% and you hit the “tipping point.” The Innovators and Early Adopters are comfortable making that “gut decision” because they believe something.

They were extremely well founded and market conditions were fantastic. But TiVo failed. They have never made money. When they launched their product they were talking about what they had. They said: \\\"We have a product that poses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking. And the cynical majority said, \\\"We don't believe you. We dont need it, we don't like it, you are scaring us.</p>\\n<p>What if they had said, \\\"If you are the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, do we have a product for you? It paused live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc. <strong>People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.</strong> And what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-04739.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 35.35714285714286%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Why\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/mlk-f60c0da79bc72279b5a216d910d7895f-04739.jpg 840w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Lets talk about successful example. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mal in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. How he did that? Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in Marica who suffered in a pre-civil right America. In fact, some of his ideas wre bad. But he had a gift. He didn't do around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. And people who believed what he believed, took his case and they made it their own. They were telling other people about that. Just like that 250,000 people showed up on the right place at the right time to hear him speak. Non of those people showed up for him, they were there for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for 8 hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It was not black versus white it was 25% of the audience white. His speech was not about \\\"I have a plan\\\" it was about \\\"I have a dream\\\". He was a real leader and he inspired. We as individuals and organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves. </p>\\n<p>This case study was taken from the Simon Sinek speech which you can find:</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"370\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/why\",\"title\":\" Case Study I Start with Why\",\"order\":18}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/change\",\"title\":\"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/economic\",\"title\":\"Assessing Economic Conditions\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/marketplace\",\"title\":\"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/ethics\",\"title\":\"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/communication\",\"title\":\"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/business-formation\",\"title\":\"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/midterm\",\"title\":\"Midterm exam\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/entrepreneurship\",\"title\":\"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/accounting\",\"title\":\"Accounting: Decision Making by the Numbers\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/finance\",\"title\":\"Finance: Acquiring and Using Funds to Maximize Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/marketing\",\"title\":\"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/product-and-promotion\",\"title\":\"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/ps\",\"title\":\"Distribution and Pricing: Product, Person, Place, Price\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/management-motivation-leadership\",\"title\":\"Management, Motivation, and Leadership: Bringing Business to Life\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/human-resource\",\"title\":\"Human Resource Management: Building a Top-Quality Workforce \"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/operations-management\",\"title\":\"Operations Management: Putting It All Together\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/presentations\",\"title\":\"Presentations\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/why\",\"title\":\" Case Study I Start with Why\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/amazon\",\"title\":\"Case Study II Amazon.com\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/alibaba\",\"title\":\"Alibaba.com\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/why.json\n// module id = 499\n// module chunks = 126031292184627"],"sourceRoot":""}
