But since the legal system is far from perfect, in rare instances your actions can be illegal, yet still ethical.</p>\\n<p><em>The Kala Dera</em> is a large village in India. Agriculture is th primary source of livelihood. Coca-Cola started its bottling operations in Kaladera in 2004, and within a year, the community started to notice a rapid decline in groundwater levels. Kaladera lies in an overexploited graudwater area and access to water has been difficult. The problem was especially visible in the summer, villagers had intense water shortages and Coca-Cola hed a highest peak in production. Villagers challenge the Coca-Cola for the worsening water conditions and demanded the closure of the company. Coca-Cola did not wabnt to close their bottling operations and they spend 2.5B annually on public relations, attempting to convince the public that it has responsible practices and is investing in water conservation efforts. It failed and had to close this facility.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<!-- Social responsibility is the obligation of a business to contribute to society.

According to the ERC, key elements of a strong culture include displays of ethics-related ac- tions at all levels of an organization and accountability for actions. The impact of these elements can be dramatic.</p>\\n<p>A strong organizational culture works in tandem with formal ethics programs to create and maintain ethical work environments. A <strong>written code of ethics</strong> is the cornerstone of any formal ethics program. The purpose of a written code is to give employees the information they need to make ethical decisions across a range of situations. Clearly, an ethics code becomes even more important for multinational companies, since it lays out unifying values and priorities for divisions that are rooted in different cultures. But a written code is worthless if it doesn’t reflect living principles. An effective code of ethics flows directly from ethical corporate values and leads directly to ongoing com- munication, training, and action.</p>\\n<p>To bring a code of ethics to life, experts advocate a forceful, integrated approach to ethics that virtually always includes the following steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Get executive buy-in and commitment to follow through. <strong>Top managers</strong> need to communicate — even over communicate — about the importance of ethics. But talking works only when it’s backed up by action: senior management must give priority to keeping promises and leading by example.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Establish expectations for ethical behavior</strong> at all levels of the organization, from the CEO to the nighttime cleaning crew. Be sure that outside parties such as suppliers, distributors, and customers understand the standards.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Integrate ethics into mandatory <strong>staff training</strong>. From new employee orientation to ongoing training, ethics must play a role. Additional, more specialized training helps employees who face more temptation (e.g., purchasing agents, overseas\\nsales reps).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ensure that your ethics code is both <strong>global and local</strong> in scope. Employees in every country should understand both the general principles and the specific applications. Be sure to trans- late it into as many languages as necessary.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Build and maintain a clear, trusted <strong>reporting structure</strong> for ethical concerns and violations. The structure should allow employees to seek anonymous guidance for ethical concerns and to report ethics violations anonymously.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Establish protection for <strong>whistle-blowers</strong>, people who report illegal or unethical behavior. Be sure that no retaliation occurs, in compliance with both ethics and the <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</strong>. Some have even suggested that whistle-blowers should receive a portion of the penalties levied against firms that violate the law.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Enforce the code of ethics</strong>. When people violate ethical norms, companies must respond immediately and—whenever appropriate — publicly to retain employee trust. Without enforcement, the code of ethics becomes meaningless.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2 id=\\\"defining-social-responsibility-making-the-world-a-better-place\\\"><a href=\\\"#defining-social-responsibility-making-the-world-a-better-place\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Defining Social Responsibility: Making the World a Better Place</h2>\\n<p><strong>Social responsibility</strong> is the obligation of a business to contribute to society. Similar to ethics, the broad definition is clear, but specific implementation can be complex. Obviously, the number-one goal of any business is <strong>long-term profits</strong>; without profits, other contributions are impossible. But once a firm achieves a reasonable return, the balancing act begins: How can a company balance the need to contribute against the need to boost profits, especially when the two conflict? The answer depends on the business’s <em>values</em>, <em>mission</em>, <em>resources</em>, and <em>management philosophy</em>, which lead in turn to its position on social responsibility. </p>\\n<p>Example: Google sent some of their employees to <em>Africa</em> to teach people valuable skills, such us programming, finance, management, engineering. This is also part of the google mission: <em>\\\"To share and make information available.\\\"</em></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-stakeholder-approach\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-stakeholder-approach\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Stakeholder Approach:</h3>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-1fcee.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 59.523809523809526%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"stakeholders\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-1fcee.jpg 1134w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p><em>Stakeholders are any groups that have a stake or a personal interest in the performance and actions of an organization</em>.

But two months later, Apple dropped the price of the phone by $200 to expand the user base further. Not surprisingly, early adopters were livid—why, they demanded, did Apple repay their trust and support by ripping them off? CEO Steve Jobs quickly apologized and offered every $599 iPhone customer a $100 Apple store credit. The response seemed to work. In 2008, Apple’s ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index climbed 8%, a full 10 percentage points ahead of its nearest competitor, maintaining a dramatic lead through 2011.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-ebf7e.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.71428571428571%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"apple27\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-ebf7e.jpg 700w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The primary <strong>responsibility of business to investors</strong> is clearly to make money — to create an ongoing stream of profits. But companies achieve and maintain long-term earnings in the context of responsibility to all stakeholders, which may mean trading short-term profits for long-term success. Responsibility to investors starts by meeting legal requirements but beyond legal requirements, companies have a number of additional responsibilities to investors. <strong>Spending money</strong> wisely would be near the top of the list.</p>\\n<p><strong>Responsibility to the Community:</strong> Business and the Greater Good Beyond increasing everyone’s standard of living, businesses can contribute to society in two main ways: <strong>Corporate Philanthropy</strong> and <strong>Corporate Responsibility</strong>.</p>\\n<p><em>Corporate philanthropy</em> includes all business <strong>donations</strong> to nonprofit groups, including both money and products. The Giving USA Foundation reported that total corporate donations increased 13.7% in 2014, a banner year for giving across all sources (perhaps due to the improved economy) It also includes donations of employee time; in other words,some companies pay their employees to spend time volunteering at nonprofits. </p>\\n<p>Some companies contribute to nonprofits through cause-related marketing. This involves a partnership between a business and a nonprofit, designed to spike sales for the company and raise money for the nonprofit. Unlike outright gifts, these dollars are not tax deductible for the company, but they can certainly build the company’s brands.</p>\\n<p><em>Corporate responsibility</em> relates closely to philanthropy but focuses on the <strong>actions of the business itself</strong> rather than donations of money and time. In 2013, Starbucks announced a strategic commitment to hire and develop at least 10,000 U.S. military veterans and active-duty spouses over the next five years, in response to its record growth. Taking a different approach to corporate responsibility. Free meal example.</p>\\n<p><strong>Responsibility to the Environment:</strong> Protecting the environment is perhaps the most crucial element of responsibility to the community. Business is a huge consumer of the world’s limited resources, from oil, to timber, to fresh water, to minerals. In some cases, the production process decimates the environment and spews pollution into the air, land, and water, sometimes causing irreversible damage. And the products created by business can cause pollution as well, such as the smog generated by cars and the sometimes-toxic waste caused by junked electronic parts. The government sets minimum standards for environmental protection at the federal, state, and local levels. But a growing number of companies are going further, developing innovative strategies to build their businesses while protecting the environment. Many have embraced the idea of <strong>sustainable development</strong>: doing business to meet the needs of this generation without harming the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This means weaving environmentalism throughout the business decision-making process. Since sustainable development can mean significant long-term cost savings, the economic crisis may even push forward environmentally friendly programs. The results of sustainability programs have been impressive across a range of industries. McDonald’s, for instance, produces mountains of garbage each year, as do virtually all major fast-food chains. But the Golden Arches stands above the others in its attempts to reduce the problem. Following are some encouraging statistics:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>By the end of 2008, McDonald’s UK was recycling 100% of its used cooking oil for biodiesel to fuel delivery trucks. This equates to 1,500 family cars being removed from the road each year.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A growing number of companies use <strong>green marketing</strong> to promote their businesses. This means marketing environmental products and practices to gain a competitive edge. Patagonia, for example, markets outdoor clothing using 100% organic cotton and natural fibers such as hemp. But green marketing represents a tough challenge: while most people support the idea of green products, the vast majority won’t sacrifice price, performance, or convenience to actually buy those products. Sometimes, however, green marketing can be quite consistent with profitability. The Toyota Prius hybrid car offers an interesting example. The Prius costs several thousand dollars more than a standard car, but as gas prices skyrocketed through the summer of 2008, consumers flooded the dealerships, snapping up Prius hybrids faster than Toyota could ship them. Yet, when the economy dropped in late 2008, Toyota sales plummeted along with the rest of the industry, suggesting that the environment may be a fair-weather priority for consumers. But by 2012, Prius sales again were soaring, especially with the introduction of the plug-in hybrid version</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"ethics-and-social-responsibility-in-the-global-arena-a-house-of-mirrors\\\"><a href=\\\"#ethics-and-social-responsibility-in-the-global-arena-a-house-of-mirrors\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Ethics and Social Responsibility in the Global Arena: A House of Mirrors?</h3>\\n<p>Globalization has made ethics and social responsibility even more complicated for workers at every level. <strong>Bribery</strong> and <strong>corruption</strong> are among the most challenging issues faced by companies and individuals that are involved in international business. Transparency International, a leading anti corruption organization, published its yearly index of “perceived corruption” across 168 countries in 2015. No country scored a completely clean 100 out of 100, and the United States scored a troubling 76, which was quite a bit higher than India at 38 and China at 37, but lower than most of the European countries that dominated the top of the list. Not surprisingly, the world’s poorest countries fall largely in the bottom half of the index, with African and Central Asian countries clustered at the very bottom, suggesting that rampant corruption is part of their business culture. Corruption wouldn’t be possible if companies didn’t offer bribes, so Transparency International also researched the likelihood of firms from industrialized countries to pay bribes abroad. </p>\\n<p>In the early 1990s, Levi Strauss “discovered that two of its suppliers in Bangladesh were employing children under the age of 14 — a practice that violated the company’s principles but was tolerated in Bangladesh. Forcing the suppliers to fire the children would not have ensured that the children received an education, and it would have caused serious hardship for the families depending on the children’s wages. In a creative arrangement, the suppliers agreed to pay the children’s regular wages while they attended school and to offer each child a job at age 14. Levi Strauss, in turn, agreed to pay the children’s tuition and provide books and uniforms.” This creative solution allowed the suppliers to maintain their valuable contracts from Levi Strauss, while Levi Strauss upheld its values and improved the quality of life for its most vulnerable workers. Clearly, codes of conduct work best with monitoring, enforcement, and a commitment to finding solutions that work for all parties involved. </p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/ethics\",\"title\":\"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good\",\"order\":4}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/change\",\"title\":\"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/economic\",\"title\":\"Assessing Economic Conditions\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/marketplace\",\"title\":\"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/ethics\",\"title\":\"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/communication\",\"title\":\"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/business-formation\",\"title\":\"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/midterm\",\"title\":\"Midterm exam\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/entrepreneurship\",\"title\":\"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/accounting\",\"title\":\"Accounting: Decision Making by the Numbers\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/finance\",\"title\":\"Finance: Acquiring and Using Funds to Maximize Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/marketing\",\"title\":\"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/product-and-promotion\",\"title\":\"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/ps\",\"title\":\"Distribution and Pricing: Product, Person, Place, Price\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/management-motivation-leadership\",\"title\":\"Management, Motivation, and Leadership: Bringing Business to Life\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/human-resource\",\"title\":\"Human Resource Management: Building a Top-Quality Workforce \"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/operations-management\",\"title\":\"Operations Management: Putting It All Together\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/presentations\",\"title\":\"Presentations\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/why\",\"title\":\" Case Study I Start with Why\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/amazon\",\"title\":\"Case Study II Amazon.com\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/alibaba\",\"title\":\"Alibaba.com\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---ethics-ce9b172afbe3ba82dd57.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<!-- //write an intro\\n//## Defining Ethics -->\\n<!-- stefan.lastric@stu.ibu.edu.ba\\n    elevejt@gmail.com aldin.berisa@stu.ibu.edu.ba -->\\n<p><strong>Ethics</strong> refers to sets of beliefs about right and wrong, good and bad; business ethics involve the application of these issues in the workplace.

The function of laws elsewhere is to establish and enforce ethical norms that apply to everyone within our society. <strong>Laws provide basic standards of behavior</strong>. But truly ethical behavior goes beyond the basics. In other words, your actions can be completely legal, yet still unethical. But since the legal system is far from perfect, in rare instances your actions can be illegal, yet still ethical.</p>\\n<p><em>The Kala Dera</em> is a large village in India. Agriculture is th primary source of livelihood. Coca-Cola started its bottling operations in Kaladera in 2004, and within a year, the community started to notice a rapid decline in groundwater levels. Kaladera lies in an overexploited graudwater area and access to water has been difficult. The problem was especially visible in the summer, villagers had intense water shortages and Coca-Cola hed a highest peak in production. Villagers challenge the Coca-Cola for the worsening water conditions and demanded the closure of the company. Coca-Cola did not wabnt to close their bottling operations and they spend 2.5B annually on public relations, attempting to convince the public that it has responsible practices and is investing in water conservation efforts. It failed and had to close this facility.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<!-- Social responsibility is the obligation of a business to contribute to society. The most socially responsible firms feature proactive policies that focus on meeting the needs of all their stakeholders — not just investors but also employees, customers, the broader community, and the environment. The stance of a company regarding social responsibility sets the tone for the organization and clearly influences the decisions of individual employees.\\n\\nAlthough this chapter discusses ethics and social responsibility separately, keep in mind that the two areas have a dynamic, interactive relationship that plays a vital role in building both profitable businesses and a vibrant community. -->\\n<h2 id=\\\"creating-and-maintaining-an-ethical-organization\\\"><a href=\\\"#creating-and-maintaining-an-ethical-organization\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Creating and Maintaining an Ethical Organization</h2>\\n<p>Research from the Ethics Resource Center (ERC) suggests that organizational culture has more influence than any other variable on the ethical conduct of individual employ- ees. According to the ERC, key elements of a strong culture include displays of ethics-related ac- tions at all levels of an organization and accountability for actions. The impact of these elements can be dramatic.</p>\\n<p>A strong organizational culture works in tandem with formal ethics programs to create and maintain ethical work environments. A <strong>written code of ethics</strong> is the cornerstone of any formal ethics program. The purpose of a written code is to give employees the information they need to make ethical decisions across a range of situations. Clearly, an ethics code becomes even more important for multinational companies, since it lays out unifying values and priorities for divisions that are rooted in different cultures. But a written code is worthless if it doesn’t reflect living principles. An effective code of ethics flows directly from ethical corporate values and leads directly to ongoing com- munication, training, and action.</p>\\n<p>To bring a code of ethics to life, experts advocate a forceful, integrated approach to ethics that virtually always includes the following steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Get executive buy-in and commitment to follow through. <strong>Top managers</strong> need to communicate — even over communicate — about the importance of ethics. But talking works only when it’s backed up by action: senior management must give priority to keeping promises and leading by example.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Establish expectations for ethical behavior</strong> at all levels of the organization, from the CEO to the nighttime cleaning crew. Be sure that outside parties such as suppliers, distributors, and customers understand the standards.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Integrate ethics into mandatory <strong>staff training</strong>. From new employee orientation to ongoing training, ethics must play a role. Additional, more specialized training helps employees who face more temptation (e.g., purchasing agents, overseas\\nsales reps).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ensure that your ethics code is both <strong>global and local</strong> in scope. Employees in every country should understand both the general principles and the specific applications. Be sure to trans- late it into as many languages as necessary.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Build and maintain a clear, trusted <strong>reporting structure</strong> for ethical concerns and violations. The structure should allow employees to seek anonymous guidance for ethical concerns and to report ethics violations anonymously.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Establish protection for <strong>whistle-blowers</strong>, people who report illegal or unethical behavior. Be sure that no retaliation occurs, in compliance with both ethics and the <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</strong>. Some have even suggested that whistle-blowers should receive a portion of the penalties levied against firms that violate the law.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Enforce the code of ethics</strong>. When people violate ethical norms, companies must respond immediately and—whenever appropriate — publicly to retain employee trust. Without enforcement, the code of ethics becomes meaningless.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2 id=\\\"defining-social-responsibility-making-the-world-a-better-place\\\"><a href=\\\"#defining-social-responsibility-making-the-world-a-better-place\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Defining Social Responsibility: Making the World a Better Place</h2>\\n<p><strong>Social responsibility</strong> is the obligation of a business to contribute to society. Similar to ethics, the broad definition is clear, but specific implementation can be complex. Obviously, the number-one goal of any business is <strong>long-term profits</strong>; without profits, other contributions are impossible. But once a firm achieves a reasonable return, the balancing act begins: How can a company balance the need to contribute against the need to boost profits, especially when the two conflict? The answer depends on the business’s <em>values</em>, <em>mission</em>, <em>resources</em>, and <em>management philosophy</em>, which lead in turn to its position on social responsibility. </p>\\n<p>Example: Google sent some of their employees to <em>Africa</em> to teach people valuable skills, such us programming, finance, management, engineering. This is also part of the google mission: <em>\\\"To share and make information available.\\\"</em></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-stakeholder-approach\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-stakeholder-approach\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Stakeholder Approach:</h3>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-1fcee.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 59.523809523809526%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBAX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB7C6FKZQT/8QAGhABAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgESAAMRIv/aAAgBAQABBQK/rYuHUpR5GI2gmsf/xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRQf/aAAgBAwEBPwGVYI//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAZEAACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAhUTH/2gAIAQEABj8CSK0vTk//xAAaEAEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVFx/9oACAEBAAE/Ia9Xai2ZfUYKuNrpfyHUqbeQ2BXb2f/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQzw//xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMf/aAAgBAwEBPxBmVIMH/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERQf/aAAgBAgEBPxBXRn//xAAcEAEBAAMAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhUTFBoWH/2gAIAQEAAT8QffXn32XxhFpAWDvTCfsQIjqHDP3NbFvcGkTZF+mEnnZF+BzP/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"stakeholders\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/stakeholders-in-business-change-39b909dca5059f93bb875e524e0d1b23-1fcee.jpg 1134w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p><em>Stakeholders are any groups that have a stake or a personal interest in the performance and actions of an organization</em>.

But in the short term, planned obsolescence thins consumer wallets and abuses consumer trust. </p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-99134.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 61.16666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"quality\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/Quality-62a64186fd9712030051ddb8486ceaa9-99134.jpg 1200w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>When businesses do make mistakes, apologizing to consumers won’t guarantee renewed sales. But a sincere apology can definitely restore a company’s reputation, which can ultimately lead to greater profits. Three examples make this point clear:</p>\\n<p>Apple Angst: Apple introduced the iPhone on June 29, 2007, to rave reviews and stellar sales, despite the $599 price tag. But two months later, Apple dropped the price of the phone by $200 to expand the user base further. Not surprisingly, early adopters were livid—why, they demanded, did Apple repay their trust and support by ripping them off? CEO Steve Jobs quickly apologized and offered every $599 iPhone customer a $100 Apple store credit. The response seemed to work. In 2008, Apple’s ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index climbed 8%, a full 10 percentage points ahead of its nearest competitor, maintaining a dramatic lead through 2011.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-ebf7e.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.71428571428571%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"apple27\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/apple27-d823d38da6ce7015bfebd6514f8f4dc7-ebf7e.jpg 700w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The primary <strong>responsibility of business to investors</strong> is clearly to make money — to create an ongoing stream of profits. But companies achieve and maintain long-term earnings in the context of responsibility to all stakeholders, which may mean trading short-term profits for long-term success. Responsibility to investors starts by meeting legal requirements but beyond legal requirements, companies have a number of additional responsibilities to investors. <strong>Spending money</strong> wisely would be near the top of the list.</p>\\n<p><strong>Responsibility to the Community:</strong> Business and the Greater Good Beyond increasing everyone’s standard of living, businesses can contribute to society in two main ways: <strong>Corporate Philanthropy</strong> and <strong>Corporate Responsibility</strong>.</p>\\n<p><em>Corporate philanthropy</em> includes all business <strong>donations</strong> to nonprofit groups, including both money and products. The Giving USA Foundation reported that total corporate donations increased 13.7% in 2014, a banner year for giving across all sources (perhaps due to the improved economy) It also includes donations of employee time; in other words,some companies pay their employees to spend time volunteering at nonprofits. </p>\\n<p>Some companies contribute to nonprofits through cause-related marketing. This involves a partnership between a business and a nonprofit, designed to spike sales for the company and raise money for the nonprofit. Unlike outright gifts, these dollars are not tax deductible for the company, but they can certainly build the company’s brands.</p>\\n<p><em>Corporate responsibility</em> relates closely to philanthropy but focuses on the <strong>actions of the business itself</strong> rather than donations of money and time. In 2013, Starbucks announced a strategic commitment to hire and develop at least 10,000 U.S. military veterans and active-duty spouses over the next five years, in response to its record growth. Taking a different approach to corporate responsibility. Free meal example.</p>\\n<p><strong>Responsibility to the Environment:</strong> Protecting the environment is perhaps the most crucial element of responsibility to the community. Business is a huge consumer of the world’s limited resources, from oil, to timber, to fresh water, to minerals. In some cases, the production process decimates the environment and spews pollution into the air, land, and water, sometimes causing irreversible damage. And the products created by business can cause pollution as well, such as the smog generated by cars and the sometimes-toxic waste caused by junked electronic parts. The government sets minimum standards for environmental protection at the federal, state, and local levels. But a growing number of companies are going further, developing innovative strategies to build their businesses while protecting the environment. Many have embraced the idea of <strong>sustainable development</strong>: doing business to meet the needs of this generation without harming the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This means weaving environmentalism throughout the business decision-making process. Since sustainable development can mean significant long-term cost savings, the economic crisis may even push forward environmentally friendly programs. The results of sustainability programs have been impressive across a range of industries. McDonald’s, for instance, produces mountains of garbage each year, as do virtually all major fast-food chains. But the Golden Arches stands above the others in its attempts to reduce the problem. Following are some encouraging statistics:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>By the end of 2008, McDonald’s UK was recycling 100% of its used cooking oil for biodiesel to fuel delivery trucks. This equates to 1,500 family cars being removed from the road each year.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A growing number of companies use <strong>green marketing</strong> to promote their businesses. This means marketing environmental products and practices to gain a competitive edge. Patagonia, for example, markets outdoor clothing using 100% organic cotton and natural fibers such as hemp. But green marketing represents a tough challenge: while most people support the idea of green products, the vast majority won’t sacrifice price, performance, or convenience to actually buy those products. Sometimes, however, green marketing can be quite consistent with profitability. The Toyota Prius hybrid car offers an interesting example. The Prius costs several thousand dollars more than a standard car, but as gas prices skyrocketed through the summer of 2008, consumers flooded the dealerships, snapping up Prius hybrids faster than Toyota could ship them. Yet, when the economy dropped in late 2008, Toyota sales plummeted along with the rest of the industry, suggesting that the environment may be a fair-weather priority for consumers. But by 2012, Prius sales again were soaring, especially with the introduction of the plug-in hybrid version</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"ethics-and-social-responsibility-in-the-global-arena-a-house-of-mirrors\\\"><a href=\\\"#ethics-and-social-responsibility-in-the-global-arena-a-house-of-mirrors\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Ethics and Social Responsibility in the Global Arena: A House of Mirrors?</h3>\\n<p>Globalization has made ethics and social responsibility even more complicated for workers at every level. <strong>Bribery</strong> and <strong>corruption</strong> are among the most challenging issues faced by companies and individuals that are involved in international business. Transparency International, a leading anti corruption organization, published its yearly index of “perceived corruption” across 168 countries in 2015. No country scored a completely clean 100 out of 100, and the United States scored a troubling 76, which was quite a bit higher than India at 38 and China at 37, but lower than most of the European countries that dominated the top of the list. Not surprisingly, the world’s poorest countries fall largely in the bottom half of the index, with African and Central Asian countries clustered at the very bottom, suggesting that rampant corruption is part of their business culture. Corruption wouldn’t be possible if companies didn’t offer bribes, so Transparency International also researched the likelihood of firms from industrialized countries to pay bribes abroad. </p>\\n<p>In the early 1990s, Levi Strauss “discovered that two of its suppliers in Bangladesh were employing children under the age of 14 — a practice that violated the company’s principles but was tolerated in Bangladesh. Forcing the suppliers to fire the children would not have ensured that the children received an education, and it would have caused serious hardship for the families depending on the children’s wages. In a creative arrangement, the suppliers agreed to pay the children’s regular wages while they attended school and to offer each child a job at age 14. Levi Strauss, in turn, agreed to pay the children’s tuition and provide books and uniforms.” This creative solution allowed the suppliers to maintain their valuable contracts from Levi Strauss, while Levi Strauss upheld its values and improved the quality of life for its most vulnerable workers. Clearly, codes of conduct work best with monitoring, enforcement, and a commitment to finding solutions that work for all parties involved. </p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/ethics\",\"title\":\"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good\",\"order\":4}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/change\",\"title\":\"Business Now: Change Is the Only Constant\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/economic\",\"title\":\"Assessing Economic Conditions\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/marketplace\",\"title\":\"The World Marketplace: Business without Borders\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/ethics\",\"title\":\"Business Ethics and Social Responsibility: Doing Well by Doing Good\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/communication\",\"title\":\"Business Communication: Creating and Delivering Messages that Matter\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/business-formation\",\"title\":\"Business Formation: Choosing the Form that Fits\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/midterm\",\"title\":\"Midterm exam\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/entrepreneurship\",\"title\":\"Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Economic Rocket Fuel\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/accounting\",\"title\":\"Accounting: Decision Making by the Numbers\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/finance\",\"title\":\"Finance: Acquiring and Using Funds to Maximize Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/marketing\",\"title\":\"Marketing: Building Profitable Customer Connections\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/product-and-promotion\",\"title\":\"Product and Promotion: Creating and Communicating Value\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/ps\",\"title\":\"Distribution and Pricing: Product, Person, Place, Price\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/management-motivation-leadership\",\"title\":\"Management, Motivation, and Leadership: Bringing Business to Life\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/human-resource\",\"title\":\"Human Resource Management: Building a Top-Quality Workforce \"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/operations-management\",\"title\":\"Operations Management: Putting It All Together\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/presentations\",\"title\":\"Presentations\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/why\",\"title\":\" Case Study I Start with Why\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/amazon\",\"title\":\"Case Study II Amazon.com\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/alibaba\",\"title\":\"Alibaba.com\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/ethics.json\n// module id = 485\n// module chunks = 126957056372065"],"sourceRoot":""}
