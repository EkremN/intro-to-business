Industries rise — and sometimes fall — in the course of a few short months. Technologies forge instant connections across the globe. Powerful new trends surface and submerge, sometimes within less than a year. In this fast-paced, fluid environment, change is the only constant.</p>\\n<p>Trendwatching.com and author Ian Altman  recently identified ten trends likely to shape the\\nworld of business:</p>\\n<p><strong>Instant Skills:</strong>\\nInstagram made us all professional photographers. Millions of status-hungry “consumers will care less\\nabout what they have or buy and more about what\\nthey can do or create”—seeking services that eliminate\\ntime and learning barriers to their creation of professional quality output.</p>\\n<p><strong>Fast-Laning:</strong>\\nNo one likes to wait in line. But if you\\ninvest your time and money in your favorite brand, you may not need to. Hyatt, and Hilton hotel\\nchains have all tested programs allowing frequent\\nguests to check in via their apps and use their cell\\nphones as room keys, to avoid wait lines at the\\nfront desk.</p>\\n<p><strong>Fun and Games:</strong>\\nWouldn’t you rather do something fun than something boring? Similarly, workplace messaging app Slack became\\none of the fastest growing business applications in\\nhistory due, in part, to its playful sense of humor. For\\ninstance, Slack allows users to create custom emojis\\nusing colleagues’ faces and displays error messages </p>\\n<p><strong>Branded Governments:</strong>\\nDo you believe that governments alone can solve today’s problems?\\nWhen Ebola swept across West Africa in 2014, mobile app Easy Taxi partnered with Dettol to offer Nigerian cab drivers lessons\\non how to diagnose and prevent the disease, encouraging\\ndrivers to pass on their knowledge to passengers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Taking Millennials Seriously:</strong>\\nThe millennial generation—comprised of people born between\\n1980 and 1996—likely includes most of the people reading this text. Millennials have been at the butt end of a lot of jokes about their outsized sense of entitlement, large number of meaningless trophies, and “addiction” to their cell phones.\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU\\\">Video</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Robolove:</strong>\\nEveryone knows that robots can save time and money—and who doesn’t like efficiency? Many people imagine a bleak robotic future with robocops out of control and robo-workers putting human workers out of work. For instance, Düsseldorf Airport in Germany recently unveiled the world’s first robotic parking valet. Customers leave their car, and a robot picks it up and positions the vehicle in one of 249 dedicated spaces. The system connects to the airport’s flight database, meaning that customers find their vehicle ready and waiting for them upon their return. Hard to get more convenient than that—and the robotic valet doesn’t even expect a tip!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"business-basics-some-key-definition\\\"><a href=\\\"#business-basics-some-key-definition\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Business Basics: Some Key Definition</h2>\\n<p><strong>Business</strong> ia any organization or activity that provides goods and services in an effort to earn a profit.</p>\\n<p><strong>Profit</strong> is the financial reward that comes\\nfrom starting and running a business. More specifically,\\nprofit is the money that a business earns in sales (or\\nrevenue), minus expenses such as the cost of goods\\nand the cost of salaries. </p>\\n<p><strong>Profit</strong> = <em>Revenue</em> - <em>Expenses</em>  </p>\\n<p>Clearly, not every business earns a profit all the time. When a business brings in less money than it needs to cover expenses, it incurs a <strong>loss</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Let's think business. If you launch a music label, for instance, you’ll need to pay your artists, lease a studio, and purchase equipment, among other expenses. If your label generates hits, you’ll earn more than enough to cover all your expenses and make yourself rich. Just the possibility of earning a profit provides a powerful incentive for people of all backgrounds to launch their own enterprises.</p>\\n<p>Core goal of any business is to generate long-term profits by delivering unsurpassed <strong>value</strong> to their customers.</p>\\n<p>People who do risk their time, money, and other\\nresources to start and manage a business are called\\n<strong>entrepreneurs</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled</p>\\n<p><strong>Pursuit:</strong> the actions of an individual entrepreneur — drive, resiliency, focus, discipline, and balance\\n<strong>Opportunity:</strong> the type of venture — a better, cheaper, or more efficient offering for the customer\\n<strong>Beyond resources controlled:</strong> managing the risks of external constraints</p>\\n<p>Interestingly, as entrepreneurs create wealth for themselves, they produce a ripple effect that enriches everyone around them. For instance, if your new website becomes the next Facebook, who will benefit? Clearly, you will. And you’ll probably spend at least some of that money enriching your local clubs, clothing stores, and car dealerships. But others will benefit, too, including your members, advertisers on your site and the staff who support them, contractors who build your facilities, and the government that collects your taxes. The impact of one successful entrepreneur can extend to the far reaches of the economy. In fact, fast growing new firms generate about 10% of all new jobs in any given year. Multiply the impact by thousands of entrepreneurs — each working in his or her own self interest—and you can see how the profit motive benefits virtually everyone. From a bigger-picture perspective, business drives up the standard of living for people worldwide, contributing to a <strong>higher quality of life</strong>. Businesses not only provide the products and services that people enjoy but also provide the jobs that people need. Beyond the obvious, business contributes to society through innovation — think cars, TVs, and tablet computers. Business also helps raise the standard of living through taxes, which the government spends on projects that range from streetlights to environmental cleanup.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"nonprofits-and-the-economy-the-business-of-doing-good\\\"><a href=\\\"#nonprofits-and-the-economy-the-business-of-doing-good\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Nonprofits and the Economy: The Business of Doing Good</h2>\\n<p>Nonprofit organizations play a critical role in the economy, often working hand-in-hand with businesses to improve the quality of life in our society. Focusing on areas such as health, human services, education, art, religion, and culture,nonprofits are business-like establishments, but their primary goals do not include profits. Nonprofit Roundtable, explains: “By definition, nonprofits are not in the business of financial gain. We’re in the business of doing good. However, nonprofits are still businesses in every other sense—they employ people, they take in revenue, they produce goods and services and contribute in significant ways to our region’s economic stability and growth.”</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-connection-economy\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-connection-economy\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Connection Economy</h3>\\n<p>Success today no longer requires building great things, although there will always be big rewards for building the best new things (see Apple, Tesla, among other success stories). According to industry leaders, the most successful firms of the present rely on connection — either connecting buyers and sellers or connecting consumers and information. Uber, the largest ride - sharing company,owns no vehicles but connects people to rides and drivers to customers. Airbnb, the largest provider of accommodations, owns no real estate but connects people to lodging. Kickstarter and Indiegogo, both giants of crowdfunding, have no money to invest but may soon surpass traditional venture capital firms by connecting investors to opportunities.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"factors-of-production-the-basic-building-blocks\\\"><a href=\\\"#factors-of-production-the-basic-building-blocks\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Factors of production: The Basic Building Blocks</h2>\\n<p>Both businesses and nonprofits rely on <strong>factors of production</strong> — four fundamental resources — to achieve their objectives.

Outside factors play a vital role in determining whether each individual business succeeds or fails. Likewise, the broader business environment can make the critical difference in whether an overall economy thrives or disintegrates.

These factors are often beyond a company’s control.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"the-competitive-environment\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-competitive-environment\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Competitive Environment</h4>\\n<p>As global competition intensifies yet further, leading edge companies have focused on <strong>customer</strong> satisfaction like never before. The goal: to develop long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with customers. Getting current customers to buy more of your product is a lot less expensive than convincing potential customers to try your product for the first time. And if you transform your current customers into loyal advocates—vocal promoters of your product or service — they’ll get those new customers for you more effectively than any advertising or discount program. Companies such as Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Northwestern Mutual life insurance lead their industries in customer satisfaction, which translates into higher profits even when the competition is tough.</p>\\n<p>Customer satisfaction comes in large part from delivering unsurpassed value. The best measure of value is the size of the gap between product benefits and price. A product has value when its benefits to the customer are equal to or greater than the price that the customer pays. Keep in mind that the cheapest product doesn’t necessarily represent the best value.</p>\\n<p><strong>Leading Edge versus Bleeding Edge</strong> <em>Speed-tomarket</em>—\\nthe rate at which a firm transforms concepts into actual products — can be another key source of competitive advantage. And the pace of change just keeps getting faster. In this tumultuous setting, companies that stay ahead of the pack often enjoy a distinct advantage. But keep in mind that there’s a difference between leading edge and bleeding edge. Bleeding-edge firms launch products that fail because they’re too far ahead of the market. During the late 1990s, for example, in the heart of the dot.com boom, Webvan, a grocery delivery service, launched to huge fanfare. But the firm went bankrupt just a few years later in 2001, partly because customers weren’t yet ready to dump traditional grocery stores in favor of cyber-shopping. Leading-edge firms, on the other hand, offer products just as the market becomes ready to embrace them. Apple provides an excellent example of leading edge. You may be surprised to learn that Apple — which controls about 70% of the digital music player market—did not offer the first MP3 player. Instead, it surveyed the existing market to help develop a new product, the iPod, which was far superior in terms of design and ease-of-use. But Apple didn’t stop with one successful MP3 player. Racing to stay ahead, they soon introduced the colorful, more affordable iPod mini. And before sales reached their peak, they launched the iPod Nano, which essentially pulled the rug from under the blockbuster iPod mini just a few short months before the holiday selling season. Why? If they hadn’t done it, someone else may well have done it instead. And Apple is almost maniacally focused on maintaining its competitive lead.</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"the-workforce-advantage\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-workforce-advantage\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Workforce Advantage</h5>\\n<p>Employees can contribute another key dimension to a firm’s\\ncompetitive edge.

But more specifically, in today’s world, business technology usually refers to computers, telecommunications, and other digital tools. Over the past few decades, the impact of digital technology on business has been utterly transformative. New industries have emerged, while others have disappeared. And some fields—such as travel, banking, and music—have changed dramatically. Even in categories with relatively unchanged products, companies have leveraged technology to streamline production and create new efficiencies. Examples include new processes such as <strong>computerized billing, digital animation, and robotic manufacturing</strong>. For fast-moving firms, the technological environment represents a rich source of competitive advantage, but it clearly can be a major threat for companies that are slow to adopt or to integrate new approaches. The creation of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> has transformed not only business but also people’s lives. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can use the Web to send and receive images and data (as long as access is available). One result is the rise of e-commerce or online sales, which allow businesses to tap into a worldwide community of potential customers. In the wake of the global economic crisis, e-commerce has slowed from the breakneck 20%+ growth rates of the past five years, but even so, analysts predict that solid growth will continue.</p>\\n<p>Alternative selling strategies thrive on the Internet, giving rise to a more individualized buying experience. If you’ve browsed seller reviews on eBay or received shopping recommendations from Amazon, you’ll have a sense of how personal web marketing can feel. Online technology also allows leading edge firms to offer customized products at prices that are comparable to standardized products. On the Burton website, for instance, customers can “custom build” professional quality “Custom X” snowboards while sitting at home in their pajamas.

It also covers demographics, or the measurable characteristics of a population. Demographic factors include population size and density and specific traits such as age, gender, race, education, and income. Clearly, given all these influences, the social environment changes dramatically from country to country. And Bosnia diverse as it is its features a number of different social environments. Rather than cover the full spectrum, this section will focus on the broad social trends that have the strongest impact on Bosnian business. Understanding the various dimensions of the social environment is crucial since successful businesses must offer goods and services that respond to it.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"the-global-environment\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-global-environment\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Global Environment</h4>\\n<p>The U.S. economy operates within the context of the global environment, interacting continually with other economies. In fact, over the past two decades, technology and free trade have blurred the lines between individual economies around the world. Technology has forged unprecedented links among countries, making it cost effective—even efficient—to establish computer help centers in Mumbai to serve customers in Boston, or to hire programmers in Buenos Aires to make websites for companies in Stockholm. Not surprisingly, jobs have migrated to the <strong>lowest bidder with the highest quality</strong> — regardless of where that bidder is based. Often, the lowest bidder is based in China or India. Both economies are growing at breakneck speed, largely because they attract enormous foreign investment. Over the past couple of decades, China has been a magnet for manufacturing jobs because of the high population and low wages—about $3.50 per hour (including government - mandated benefits) versus about $19.50 in the United States — although the gap is rapidly closing due todouble - digit annual wage inflation in China. And India has been especially adept at attracting high-tech jobs, in part because of their world-class, English-speaking university graduates who are willing to work for less than their counterparts around the globe. The migration of jobs relates closely to the global movement toward free trade. In 1995, a renegotiation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) — signed by 125 countries—took bold steps to lower tariffs (taxes on imports) and to reduce trade restrictions worldwide. The result: goods move more freely than ever across international boundaries. Individual groups of countries have gone even further, creating blocs of nations with virtually unrestricted trade. Mexico, Canada, and the United States have laid the groundwork for a free-trade megamarket through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and 25 European countries have created a powerful free-trading bloc through the European Union, which has been weakened by a severe, ongoing financial crisis. The free-trade movement has lowered prices and increased quality across virtually every product category, as competition becomes truly global.

Similarly, workplace messaging app Slack became\\none of the fastest growing business applications in\\nhistory due, in part, to its playful sense of humor. For\\ninstance, Slack allows users to create custom emojis\\nusing colleagues’ faces and displays error messages </p>\\n<p><strong>Branded Governments:</strong>\\nDo you believe that governments alone can solve today’s problems?\\nWhen Ebola swept across West Africa in 2014, mobile app Easy Taxi partnered with Dettol to offer Nigerian cab drivers lessons\\non how to diagnose and prevent the disease, encouraging\\ndrivers to pass on their knowledge to passengers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Taking Millennials Seriously:</strong>\\nThe millennial generation—comprised of people born between\\n1980 and 1996—likely includes most of the people reading this text.

Many people imagine a bleak robotic future with robocops out of control and robo-workers putting human workers out of work. For instance, Düsseldorf Airport in Germany recently unveiled the world’s first robotic parking valet. Customers leave their car, and a robot picks it up and positions the vehicle in one of 249 dedicated spaces. The system connects to the airport’s flight database, meaning that customers find their vehicle ready and waiting for them upon their return.

More specifically,\\nprofit is the money that a business earns in sales (or\\nrevenue), minus expenses such as the cost of goods\\nand the cost of salaries. </p>\\n<p><strong>Profit</strong> = <em>Revenue</em> - <em>Expenses</em>  </p>\\n<p>Clearly, not every business earns a profit all the time. When a business brings in less money than it needs to cover expenses, it incurs a <strong>loss</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Let's think business. If you launch a music label, for instance, you’ll need to pay your artists, lease a studio, and purchase equipment, among other expenses. If your label generates hits, you’ll earn more than enough to cover all your expenses and make yourself rich. Just the possibility of earning a profit provides a powerful incentive for people of all backgrounds to launch their own enterprises.</p>\\n<p>Core goal of any business is to generate long-term profits by delivering unsurpassed <strong>value</strong> to their customers.</p>\\n<p>People who do risk their time, money, and other\\nresources to start and manage a business are called\\n<strong>entrepreneurs</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled</p>\\n<p><strong>Pursuit:</strong> the actions of an individual entrepreneur — drive, resiliency, focus, discipline, and balance\\n<strong>Opportunity:</strong> the type of venture — a better, cheaper, or more efficient offering for the customer\\n<strong>Beyond resources controlled:</strong> managing the risks of external constraints</p>\\n<p>Interestingly, as entrepreneurs create wealth for themselves, they produce a ripple effect that enriches everyone around them. For instance, if your new website becomes the next Facebook, who will benefit? Clearly, you will. And you’ll probably spend at least some of that money enriching your local clubs, clothing stores, and car dealerships. But others will benefit, too, including your members, advertisers on your site and the staff who support them, contractors who build your facilities, and the government that collects your taxes. The impact of one successful entrepreneur can extend to the far reaches of the economy. In fact, fast growing new firms generate about 10% of all new jobs in any given year. Multiply the impact by thousands of entrepreneurs — each working in his or her own self interest—and you can see how the profit motive benefits virtually everyone. From a bigger-picture perspective, business drives up the standard of living for people worldwide, contributing to a <strong>higher quality of life</strong>. Businesses not only provide the products and services that people enjoy but also provide the jobs that people need. Beyond the obvious, business contributes to society through innovation — think cars, TVs, and tablet computers. Business also helps raise the standard of living through taxes, which the government spends on projects that range from streetlights to environmental cleanup.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"nonprofits-and-the-economy-the-business-of-doing-good\\\"><a href=\\\"#nonprofits-and-the-economy-the-business-of-doing-good\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Nonprofits and the Economy: The Business of Doing Good</h2>\\n<p>Nonprofit organizations play a critical role in the economy, often working hand-in-hand with businesses to improve the quality of life in our society. Focusing on areas such as health, human services, education, art, religion, and culture,nonprofits are business-like establishments, but their primary goals do not include profits. Nonprofit Roundtable, explains: “By definition, nonprofits are not in the business of financial gain. We’re in the business of doing good.

The goal: to develop long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with customers. Getting current customers to buy more of your product is a lot less expensive than convincing potential customers to try your product for the first time. And if you transform your current customers into loyal advocates—vocal promoters of your product or service — they’ll get those new customers for you more effectively than any advertising or discount program. Companies such as Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Northwestern Mutual life insurance lead their industries in customer satisfaction, which translates into higher profits even when the competition is tough.</p>\\n<p>Customer satisfaction comes in large part from delivering unsurpassed value. The best measure of value is the size of the gap between product benefits and price. A product has value when its benefits to the customer are equal to or greater than the price that the customer pays. Keep in mind that the cheapest product doesn’t necessarily represent the best value.</p>\\n<p><strong>Leading Edge versus Bleeding Edge</strong> <em>Speed-tomarket</em>—\\nthe rate at which a firm transforms concepts into actual products — can be another key source of competitive advantage. And the pace of change just keeps getting faster. In this tumultuous setting, companies that stay ahead of the pack often enjoy a distinct advantage. But keep in mind that there’s a difference between leading edge and bleeding edge. Bleeding-edge firms launch products that fail because they’re too far ahead of the market. During the late 1990s, for example, in the heart of the dot.com boom, Webvan, a grocery delivery service, launched to huge fanfare. But the firm went bankrupt just a few years later in 2001, partly because customers weren’t yet ready to dump traditional grocery stores in favor of cyber-shopping. Leading-edge firms, on the other hand, offer products just as the market becomes ready to embrace them. Apple provides an excellent example of leading edge. You may be surprised to learn that Apple — which controls about 70% of the digital music player market—did not offer the first MP3 player. Instead, it surveyed the existing market to help develop a new product, the iPod, which was far superior in terms of design and ease-of-use. But Apple didn’t stop with one successful MP3 player. Racing to stay ahead, they soon introduced the colorful, more affordable iPod mini. And before sales reached their peak, they launched the iPod Nano, which essentially pulled the rug from under the blockbuster iPod mini just a few short months before the holiday selling season. Why? If they hadn’t done it, someone else may well have done it instead. And Apple is almost maniacally focused on maintaining its competitive lead.</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"the-workforce-advantage\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-workforce-advantage\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Workforce Advantage</h5>\\n<p>Employees can contribute another key dimension to a firm’s\\ncompetitive edge.

But more specifically, in today’s world, business technology usually refers to computers, telecommunications, and other digital tools. Over the past few decades, the impact of digital technology on business has been utterly transformative. New industries have emerged, while others have disappeared. And some fields—such as travel, banking, and music—have changed dramatically. Even in categories with relatively unchanged products, companies have leveraged technology to streamline production and create new efficiencies. Examples include new processes such as <strong>computerized billing, digital animation, and robotic manufacturing</strong>. For fast-moving firms, the technological environment represents a rich source of competitive advantage, but it clearly can be a major threat for companies that are slow to adopt or to integrate new approaches. The creation of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> has transformed not only business but also people’s lives. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can use the Web to send and receive images and data (as long as access is available). One result is the rise of e-commerce or online sales, which allow businesses to tap into a worldwide community of potential customers. In the wake of the global economic crisis, e-commerce has slowed from the breakneck 20%+ growth rates of the past five years, but even so, analysts predict that solid growth will continue.</p>\\n<p>Alternative selling strategies thrive on the Internet, giving rise to a more individualized buying experience. If you’ve browsed seller reviews on eBay or received shopping recommendations from Amazon, you’ll have a sense of how personal web marketing can feel. Online technology also allows leading edge firms to offer customized products at prices that are comparable to standardized products. On the Burton website, for instance, customers can “custom build” professional quality “Custom X” snowboards while sitting at home in their pajamas. Nike offers a similar service for NikeID shoes, clothing, and gear. As technology continues to evolve at breakneck speed, the scope of change—both in everyday life and business operations—is almost unimaginable. In this environment, companies that welcome change and manage it well will clearly be the winners.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"the-social-environment\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-social-environment\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Social Environment</h4>\\n<p>The social environment embodies the values, attitudes, customs, and beliefs shared by groups of people. It also covers demographics, or the measurable characteristics of a population. Demographic factors include population size and density and specific traits such as age, gender, race, education, and income. Clearly, given all these influences, the social environment changes dramatically from country to country. And Bosnia diverse as it is its features a number of different social environments. Rather than cover the full spectrum, this section will focus on the broad social trends that have the strongest impact on Bosnian business. Understanding the various dimensions of the social environment is crucial since successful businesses must offer goods and services that respond to it.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"the-global-environment\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-global-environment\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Global Environment</h4>\\n<p>The U.S. economy operates within the context of the global environment, interacting continually with other economies. In fact, over the past two decades, technology and free trade have blurred the lines between individual economies around the world. Technology has forged unprecedented links among countries, making it cost effective—even efficient—to establish computer help centers in Mumbai to serve customers in Boston, or to hire programmers in Buenos Aires to make websites for companies in Stockholm. Not surprisingly, jobs have migrated to the <strong>lowest bidder with the highest quality</strong> — regardless of where that bidder is based. Often, the lowest bidder is based in China or India. Both economies are growing at breakneck speed, largely because they attract enormous foreign investment. Over the past couple of decades, China has been a magnet for manufacturing jobs because of the high population and low wages—about $3.50 per hour (including government - mandated benefits) versus about $19.50 in the United States — although the gap is rapidly closing due todouble - digit annual wage inflation in China. And India has been especially adept at attracting high-tech jobs, in part because of their world-class, English-speaking university graduates who are willing to work for less than their counterparts around the globe. The migration of jobs relates closely to the global movement toward free trade. In 1995, a renegotiation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) — signed by 125 countries—took bold steps to lower tariffs (taxes on imports) and to reduce trade restrictions worldwide. The result: goods move more freely than ever across international boundaries. Individual groups of countries have gone even further, creating blocs of nations with virtually unrestricted trade. Mexico, Canada, and the United States have laid the groundwork for a free-trade megamarket through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and 25 European countries have created a powerful free-trading bloc through the European Union, which has been weakened by a severe, ongoing financial crisis. The free-trade movement has lowered prices and increased quality across virtually every product category, as competition becomes truly global.
