In many ways, a corporation is like an artificial person. It can legally engage in virtually any business activity a natural person can pursue. For example, a corporation can enter into binding contracts, borrow money, own property, pay taxes, and initiate legal actions (such as lawsuits) in its own name. It can even be a partner in a partnership or an owner of another corporation.Because of a corporation’s status as a separate legal entity, the owners of a corporation have <strong>limited liability</strong> — meaning they aren’t personally responsible for the debts and obligations of their company.</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"830\\\" height=\\\"420\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DImqZ-xsizo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<p>A <strong>limited liability</strong> company (LLC) is a hybrid form of business ownership that is similar in some respects to a corporation while having other characteristics that are similar to a partnership.

Also like a corporation and as its name implies an LLC offers its owners limited liability for the debts of their business. But it offers more flexibility than a corporation in terms of tax treatment; in fact, one of the most interesting characteristics of an LLC is that its owners can elect to have their business taxed either as a corporation or a partnership. Many states even allow individuals to form single person LLCs that are taxed as if they were sole proprietorships.</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"820\\\" height=\\\"430\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLcHSBjt1L4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<iframe width=\\\"820\\\" height=\\\"430\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k1nkB-ZWMQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<h2 id=\\\"61-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sole-proprietorships\\\"><a href=\\\"#61-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sole-proprietorships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.1. Advantages and disadvantages of sole proprietorships</h2>\\n<p>Sole proprietorships offer some very attractive advantages to people starting a business:</p>\\n<p><strong>Ease of Formation:</strong> Compared to the other forms\\nof ownership we’ll discuss, the paperwork and costs involved in forming a sole proprietorship are minimal. No special forms must be filed, and no special fees must be paid. Entrepreneurs who are eager to get a business up and running quickly can find this a compelling advantage.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retention of Control:</strong> As the only owner of a sole proprietorship, you’re in control. You have the ability to manage your business the way you want. If you want to “be your own boss,” a sole proprietorship might look very attractive.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pride of Ownership:</strong> One of the main reasons many people prefer a sole proprietorship is the feeling of pride and the personal satisfaction they gain from owning and running their own business.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retention of Profits:</strong> If your business is successful, all the profits go to you minus your personal taxes, of course.</p>\\n<p><strong>Possible Tax Advantage:</strong> No taxes are levied directly on the earnings of sole proprietorships as a business. Instead, the earnings are taxed only as income of the proprietor. As we’ll see when we discuss corporations, this avoids the undesirable possibility of double taxation of earnings.</p>\\n<p>Entrepreneurs thinking about forming sole proprietorships\\nshould also be aware of some serious drawbacks:</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Financial Resources:</strong> Raising money to finance growth can be tough for sole proprietors. With only one owner responsible for a sole proprietorship’s debts, banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend it money. Likewise, suppliers may be unwilling to provide supplies on credit. This leaves sole proprietors dependent on their own wealth plus the money that their firms generate.</p>\\n<p><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> Because the law views a sole proprietorship as an extension of its owner, the debts of the firm become the owner’s personal debts. If someone sues your business and wins, the court can seize your personal possessions—even those that have nothing to do with your business—and sell them to pay the damages. This unlimited personal liability means that operating as a sole proprietorship is a risky endeavor.</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Ability to Attract and Maintain Talented Employees:</strong> Most sole proprietors are unable to pay the high salaries and substantial perks that highly qualified, experienced employees get when they work for big, well-established companies.</p>\\n<p><strong>Heavy Workload and Responsibilities:</strong> Being your own boss can be very rewarding, but it can also mean very long hours and a lot of stress. Sole proprietors as the ultimate authority in their business—often must perform tasks or make decisions in areas where they lack expertise.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lack of Permanence:</strong> Because sole proprietorships are just extensions of their owners, they lack permanence. If the owner dies, retires, or withdraws from the business for some other reason, the company legally ceases to exist. Even if the company continues to operate under new ownership, in the eyes of the law, it becomes a different firm.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"62-partnerships-two-heads-and-bankrolls-can-be-better-than-one\\\"><a href=\\\"#62-partnerships-two-heads-and-bankrolls-can-be-better-than-one\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.2 Partnerships: Two heads (and bankrolls) can be better than one</h2>\\n<p>There is no limit on the number of partners who can participate in a general partnership, but most partnerships consist of only a few partners often just two. The partnership is formed when the partners enter into a voluntary partnership agreement. It is legally possible to start a partnership on the basis of a <strong>verbal agreement</strong>, but doing so is often a recipe for disaster. It’s much safer to get everything in writing and to seek expert legal assistance when drawing up the agreement. A typical partnership agreement spells out details, such as the initial financial contributions each partner will make, the specific duties and responsibilities each will assume, how they will share profits (and losses), how they will settle disagreements, and how they will deal with the death or withdrawal of one of the partners. Well written agreements can prevent common misunderstandings.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"621-advantages-of-general-partnerships\\\"><a href=\\\"#621-advantages-of-general-partnerships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.2.1 Advantages of General Partnerships</h3>\\n<p>Partnerships offer some key advantages relative to both sole proprietorships and corporations:</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Pool Financial Resources:</strong> With more owners investing in the company, a partnership is likely to have a stronger financial base than a sole proprietorship.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Share Responsibilities and Capitalize on Complementary Skills:</strong> Partners can share the burden of running the business, which can ease the workload. Tasks and jobs can also be divided based on complementary skills, using each partner’s talents to best advantage.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ease of Formation:</strong> In theory, forming a partnership is easy. As we’ve already noted, it’s possible (but not advisable) to establish a partnership based on a simple verbal agreement. But we shouldn’t overemphasize this advantage. Working out all of the details of a partnership agreement can sometimes be a complex and time consuming process.</p>\\n<p><strong>Possible Tax Advantages:</strong> Similar to a sole proprietorship, the earnings of a partnership “pass through” the business untouched by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are taxed only as the partners’ personal income. Again, this avoids the potential for double taxation endemic to corporations.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"621-disadvantages-of-general-partnerships\\\"><a href=\\\"#621-disadvantages-of-general-partnerships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.2.1 Disadvantages of General Partnerships</h3>\\n<p>General partnerships also have some serious disadvantages. Well-written partnership agreements, however, can mitigate some of these major drawbacks:</p>\\n<p><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> As a general partner, you’re not only liable for your own mistakes but also for those of your partners. In fact, all general partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of their business. So, if the assets they’ve invested in the business aren’t sufficient to meet these claims, the personal assets of the partners are at risk. When someone sues a general partnership, the lawsuit can target any individual partner or group of partners. In fact, lawsuits often go after the partners with the deepest pockets, even if they did not personally participate in the act that caused the legal action. In other words, if you have more personal wealth than the other partners, you could lose more than they do even if they were the ones at fault!</p>\\n<p><strong>Potential for Disagreements:</strong> If general partners can’t agree on how to run the business, the conflict can complicate and delay decision making. A well-drafted partnership agreement usually specifies how disputes will be resolved, but disagreements among partners can create friction and hard feelings that harm morale and undermine the cooperation needed to keep the business on track.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lack of Continuity:</strong> If a current partner <strong>withdraws</strong> from the partnership, the relationships among the participants will clearly change, potentially ending the partnership. This creates uncertainty about how long a partnership will remain in business.</p>\\n<p><strong>Difficulty in Withdrawing from a Partnership:</strong>\\nA partner who withdraws from a partnership remains personally liable for any debts or obligations the firm had at the time of withdrawal — even if those obligations were incurred by the actions of other partners.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"63-limited-partnership\\\"><a href=\\\"#63-limited-partnership\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.3 Limited Partnership</h2>\\n<p>The risks associated with unlimited liability make general partnerships unattractive to many individuals who would otherwise be interested in joining a business partnership. Fortunately, two other types of partnerships allow some partners to limit their personal liability to some extent, although each comes with particular requirements.</p>\\n<p>The first of these, known as a <strong>limited partnership</strong>, is a partnership arrangement that includes at least one general partner and at least one limited partner. Both types of partners contribute financially to the company and share in its profits. But in other respects they play different roles:</p>\\n<p>General partners have the right to participate fully in managing their partnership, but they also assume unlimited personal liability for any of its debts—just like the partners in a general partnership.</p>\\n<p>Limited partners cannot actively participate in its management, but they have the protection of limited liability. This means that, as long as they do not actively participate in managing the company, their personal wealth is not at risk.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"64-limited-liability-partnerships\\\"><a href=\\\"#64-limited-liability-partnerships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.4 Limited Liability Partnerships</h2>\\n<p>The limited liability partnership (LLP) is another partnership arrangement that is attractive to partners who want to limit their personal risk. It is similar to a limited partnership in some ways, but it has the advantage of allowing all partners to take an active role in management, while also offering all partners some form of limited liability. In other words, there’s no need to distinguish between limited and general partners in an LLP.</p>\\n<p>The amount of liability protection offered by LLPs varies among states. In some states, LLPs offer “full-shield” protection, meaning that partners have limited liability for all claims against their company, except those resulting from their own negligence or malpractice. In other states, partners in LLPs have a lesser “partial-shield” protection. In these states, each partner has limited liability for the negligence or malpractice of other partners but still has unlimited liability for any other debts. Another drawback is that some states only allow specific types of professional businesses to form limited liability partnerships. For example, California law allows only accountants, lawyers, and architects to form LLPs.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"65-corporations-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-being-an-artificial-person\\\"><a href=\\\"#65-corporations-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-being-an-artificial-person\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5 Corporations: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being an Artificial Person</h2>\\n<p>There are several types of corporations.

Forming a C Corporation</h3>\\n<p>As mentioned earlier, the formation of a corporation requires filing articles of incorporation and paying filing fees. It also requires the adoption of corporate bylaws, which are detailed rules that govern the way the corporation is organized and managed. Because of these requirements, forming a corporation tends to be more expensive and complex than forming a sole proprietorship or partnership. The requirements, however, vary among the country.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"652-ownership-of-c-corporations\\\"><a href=\\\"#652-ownership-of-c-corporations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.2. Ownership of C Corporations</h3>\\n<p>Ownership of C corporations is represented by shares of stock, so owners are called “<strong>stockholders</strong>” (or “shareholders”). Common stock represents the basic ownership interest in a corporation, but some firms also issue <strong>preferred stock</strong>. One key difference between the two types of stock involves <strong>voting rights</strong>; common stockholders normally have the right to vote in stockholders’ meetings, while preferred stockholders do not. Many large corporations issue billions of shares of stock and have hundreds of thousands or even millions of stockholders.\\nStock in large corporations is usually publicly traded, meaning that anyone with the money and inclination to do so can buy shares and that anyone who owns shares is free to sell them. But many smaller corporations are owned by just a handful of stockholders who don’t actively trade their stock. It’s even possible for individuals to incorporate their business and be the sole shareholder in their corporation.</p>\\n<p>Stockholders don’t have to be individuals. Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and endowment funds, pool money from a large number of individuals and use these funds to buy stocks and other securities. Investors own the majority of stock in many large corporations.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"653-the-role-of-the-board-of-directors\\\"><a href=\\\"#653-the-role-of-the-board-of-directors\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.3. The Role of the Board of Directors</h3>\\n<p>It’s not practical for all of the stockholders of a large corporation to actively participate in the management of their company. Besides, most stockholders don’t have the time, management skills, or desire to effectively manage such a complex business enterprise. Thus, in accordance with corporate bylaws, the stockholders elect a board of directors and rely on this board to oversee the operation of their company and protect their interests.</p>\\n<p>The board of directors establishes the corporation’s mission and sets its broad objectives. But board members seldom take an active role in the day-to-day management of their company. Instead, again in accordance with corporate bylaws, the board appoints a chief executive officer (CEO) and other corporate officers to manage the company on a daily basis. The board also sets the level of compensation for these officers and monitors their performance to ensure that they act in a manner consistent with stockholder interests. It also provides advice to these officers on broad policy issues, approves their major proposals, and ensures that the company adheres to major regulatory requirements.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"654-advantages-of-c-corporations\\\"><a href=\\\"#654-advantages-of-c-corporations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.4 Advantages of C Corporations</h3>\\n<p>Corporations have become the dominant form of business ownership for several reasons:</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> As already explained, stockholders are not personally liable for the debts of their company. If a corporation goes bankrupt, the stockholders might find that their stock is worthless, but their other personal assets are protected.</p>\\n<p><strong>Permanence:</strong> Unless the articles of incorporation specify a limited duration, corporations can continue operating as long as they <strong>remain financially viable</strong> and the majority of stockholders want the business to continue. Unlike a sole proprietorship or partnership, a general corporation is unaffected by the death or withdrawal of an owner.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ease of Transfer of Ownership:</strong> It’s easy for stockholders of publicly traded C corporations to withdraw from ownership—they simply sell their shares of stock.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Raise Large Amounts of Financial Capital:</strong> Corporations can raise large amounts of financial capital by issuing shares of stock or by selling formal IOUs called corporate bonds. The ability to raise money by issuing these securities gives corporations a major financial advantage over most other forms of ownership.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Make Use of Specialized Management:</strong> Large corporations often find it easier to hire <strong>highly qualified professional</strong> managers than proprietorships and partnerships. Major corpora- tions can typically offer attractive salaries and benefits, and their permanence and potential for growth offer managers opportunities for career advancement.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"655-disadvantages-of-c-corporations\\\"><a href=\\\"#655-disadvantages-of-c-corporations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.5. Disadvantages of C Corporations</h3>\\n<p>In addition to their significant benefits, C corporations\\nhave a number of drawbacks:</p>\\n<p><strong>Expense and Complexity of Formation and Operation:</strong> As we’ve already seen, establishing a corporation can be more complex and expensive than forming a sole proprietorship or partnership. Corporations are also subject to more formal operating requirements. For example, they are required to hold regular board meetings and keep accurate minutes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Double Taxation of Earnings and Additional Taxes:</strong> The IRS considers a C corporation to be a sep- arate legal entity and taxes its earnings accordingly. Then, as shown in Exhibit 6.4, any dividends (earnings the corporation distributes to stockholders) are taxed again as the personal income of the stockholders. This double taxation can take a big bite out of earn- ings that are distributed to shareholders. But note that corporations often reinvest some or all of their profits back into the business. Shareholders don’t pay income taxes on these retained earnings. Many states also impose separate income taxes on corporations. Most states also impose an annual franchise tax on both domestic and foreign corporations that operate within their borders.</p>\\n<p><strong>More Paperwork, More Regulation, and Less Secrecy:</strong> Corporations are more closely regulated and are required to file more <strong>government paperwork</strong> than other forms of business. Large, publicly traded corporations are required to send annual statements to all shareholders and to file detailed quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The annual report filed with the SEC (called a Form 10-K) is often hundreds of pages long and includes a wealth of information about the company’s operations and financial condition. Anyone can look at these forms, making it difficult to keep key corporate information secret from competitors.</p>\\n<p><strong>Possible Conflicts of Interest:</strong> The corporate officers appointed by the board are supposed to further the interests of stockholders. But some top executives pursue policies that further their own interests (such as prestige, power, job security, high pay, and attractive perks) at the expense of the stockholders. The board of directors has an obligation to protect the interests of stockholders, but in recent years the boards of several major corporations have come under criticism for continuing to approve high compensation packages for top executives even when their companies performed poorly.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"656-other-types-of-corporations-same-but-different\\\"><a href=\\\"#656-other-types-of-corporations-same-but-different\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.6. Other Types of Corporations: Same but Different</h3>\\n<p>Now that we’ve described C corporations, let’s take a quick look at three other types of corporations: <strong>S corporations</strong>, <strong>statutory close corporations</strong>, and <strong>nonprofit corporations</strong>. Like C corporations, each is created by filing the appropriate paperwork with a government agency. Also like general corporations, these corporations are considered legal entities that stand apart from their owners and can enter into contracts, own property, and take legal action in their own names. But in other key respects they are quite different from C corporations and from each other.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"657-corporate-restructuring\\\"><a href=\\\"#657-corporate-restructuring\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.7 Corporate Restructuring</h3>\\n<p>Large corporations constantly look for ways to grow and achieve competitive advantages. Some corporations work to achieve these goals, at least in part, through mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. We’ll close our discussion of corporations by taking a quick look at these forms of corporate restructuring.</p>\\n<p><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions</strong> In the news and casual conversation, the terms “merger” and “acquisition” are often used interchangeably. However, there’s a difference between the two. An <strong>acquisition</strong> occurs when one firm buys another firm. The firm making the purchase is called the “acquiring firm,” and the firm being purchased is called the “target firm.” After the acquisition, the target firm ceases to exist as an independent entity while the purchasing firm continues in operation, and its stock is still traded. But not all acquisitions are on friendly terms. When the acquiring firm buys the target firm despite the opposition of the target’s board and top management, the result is called a “hostile takeover.”</p>\\n<p>In a <strong>merger</strong>, instead of one firm buying the other, the two companies agree to a combination of equals, joining together to form a new company out of the two previously independent firms.</p>\\n<p><strong>Divestitures: When Less Is More</strong> Sometimes corporations restructure by subtraction rather than by ad dition. A <strong>divestiture</strong> occurs when a firm transfers total or partial ownership of some of its operations to investors or to another company. Firms of ten use divestitures to rid themselves of a part of their company that no longer fits well with their strategic plans. This allows them to streamline their operations and focus on their core businesses. In many (but not all) cases, divestitures involve the sale of assets to outsiders, which raises financial capital for the firm.</p>\\n<p>One common type of divestiture, called a “spin-off,” occurs when a company issues stock in one of its own divisions or operating units and sets it up as a separate company complete with its own board of directors and corporate officers. It then distributes the stock in the new company to its existing stockholders. After the spin-off, the stockholders end up owning two separate companies rather than one. They can then buy, sell, or hold either (or both) stocks as they see fit. While a spin-off allows a corporation to eliminate a division that no longer fits in its plans, it doesn’t actually generate any additional funds for the firm.</p>\\n<p>A “carve-out” is like a spin-off in that the firm converts a particular unit or division into a separate company and issues stock in the newly created corporation. However, instead of distributing the new stock to its current stockholders, it sells the stock to outside investors, thus raising additional financial capital. In many cases, the firm sells only a minor- ity of the total shares, so that it maintains majority ownership.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"66-the-limited-liability-company-the-new-kid-on-the-block\\\"><a href=\\\"#66-the-limited-liability-company-the-new-kid-on-the-block\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.6 THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY: THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK</h2>\\n<p>As the newest form of business ownership, state laws concerning the legal status and formation of LLCs are still evolving.

As with corporations, LLCs are created by filing a document (which goes by a variety of names, such as certificate of organization or articles of organization) and paying filing fees in the state where the business is organized. Organizers of most LLCs also draft an operating agreement, which is similar to the bylaws of a corporation. Some states also require LLCs to publish a notice of intent to operate as a limited liability company. </p>\\n<p>Because LLCs are neither corporations nor partnerships, their owners are called members rather than stockholders or partners. Members of LLCs often manage their own company under an arrangement similar to the relationship among general partners in a partnership.

Advantages of LLCs</h3>\\n<p>Why are LLCs becoming so popular? This form of owner-\\nship offers significant advantages:</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> Similar to a corporation, all owners of an LLC have limited liability.</p>\\n<p><strong>Tax Pass-Through:</strong> As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, for tax purposes the owners of LLCs may elect to have their companies treated as either a corporation or a partnership—or even as a sole proprietorship if owned by a single person. The default tax classification for LLCs with more than one owner—and the one most LLCs choose—is the partnership option. Under this arrangement, there is no rations, the owners of LLCs can include foreign investors and other corporations. However, some states do make it difficult to transfer ownership to outsiders. separate tax on the earnings of the company. Instead, earnings “pass through” the company and are taxed only as income of the owners. This eliminates the double taxation of profits that is endemic to general corporations. However, there are some cases where it makes sense for LLCs to elect to be taxed as a corporation. For example, the owner of a single-person LLC can avoid paying self-employment taxes by electing to have the LLC treated as a corporation rather than as a sole proprietorship.</p>\\n<p><strong>Simplicity and Flexibility in Management and Operation:</strong> Unlike corporations, LLCs aren’t required to hold regular board meetings. Also, LLCs are subject to less paperwork and fewer reporting requirements than corporations.</p>\\n<p><strong>Flexible Ownership:</strong> Unlike S corporations, LLCs can have any number of owners. Also unlike S corporations, the owners of LLCs can include foreign investors and other corporations.

In general, forming an LLC is also more difficult than creating\\na partnership. But as we mentioned earlier, the formation of a partnership requires a “meeting of the minds” of the partners, which isn’t always easy to achieve. So in some cases, the formation of a partnership can prove to be every bit as challenging as the formation of an LLC.\\ntheir increasing popularity, LLCs</p>\\n<p><strong>Annual Franchise Tax:</strong> Even though they may be exempt from corporate income taxes, many states require LLCs to pay an annual franchise tax. Foreign Status in Other States: Like corporations, LLCs must register or qualify to operate as “foreign” companies when they do business in states other than the state in which they were organized. This results in additional paperwork, fees, and taxes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Limits on Types of Firms that Can Form LLCs:</strong> Most states do not permit banks, insurance companies, and nonprofit organizations to operate as LLCs.</p>\\n<p><strong>Differences in State Laws:</strong> As we’ve already mentioned, LLC laws are still evolving—and their specific requirements vary considerably among the states. In 2006, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws created a Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act that could be used as a model by all states. To date, only a few states have adopted this law. Until there is more uniformity in state laws, operating LLCs in more than one state is likely to remain a complex endeavor.</p>\\n<!-- ## 6.7.

The form they choose affects virtually every aspect of establishing and operating their firm, including the initial cost of setting up the business, the way the profits are distributed, the types of taxes (if any) the business must pay, and the types of regulations it must follow. Choice of ownership also determines the degree to which each owner is personally liable for the firm’s debts and the sources of funds available to the firm to finance future expansion.</p>\\n<p>A <strong>sole proprietorship</strong> is a business that is owned, and usually managed, by a <em>single individual</em>.

In many ways, a corporation is like an artificial person. It can legally engage in virtually any business activity a natural person can pursue. For example, a corporation can enter into binding contracts, borrow money, own property, pay taxes, and initiate legal actions (such as lawsuits) in its own name. It can even be a partner in a partnership or an owner of another corporation.Because of a corporation’s status as a separate legal entity, the owners of a corporation have <strong>limited liability</strong> — meaning they aren’t personally responsible for the debts and obligations of their company.</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"830\\\" height=\\\"420\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DImqZ-xsizo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<p>A <strong>limited liability</strong> company (LLC) is a hybrid form of business ownership that is similar in some respects to a corporation while having other characteristics that are similar to a partnership.

Also like a corporation and as its name implies an LLC offers its owners limited liability for the debts of their business. But it offers more flexibility than a corporation in terms of tax treatment; in fact, one of the most interesting characteristics of an LLC is that its owners can elect to have their business taxed either as a corporation or a partnership. Many states even allow individuals to form single person LLCs that are taxed as if they were sole proprietorships.</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"820\\\" height=\\\"430\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLcHSBjt1L4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<iframe width=\\\"820\\\" height=\\\"430\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k1nkB-ZWMQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<h2 id=\\\"61-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sole-proprietorships\\\"><a href=\\\"#61-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sole-proprietorships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.1. Advantages and disadvantages of sole proprietorships</h2>\\n<p>Sole proprietorships offer some very attractive advantages to people starting a business:</p>\\n<p><strong>Ease of Formation:</strong> Compared to the other forms\\nof ownership we’ll discuss, the paperwork and costs involved in forming a sole proprietorship are minimal. No special forms must be filed, and no special fees must be paid. Entrepreneurs who are eager to get a business up and running quickly can find this a compelling advantage.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retention of Control:</strong> As the only owner of a sole proprietorship, you’re in control. You have the ability to manage your business the way you want. If you want to “be your own boss,” a sole proprietorship might look very attractive.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pride of Ownership:</strong> One of the main reasons many people prefer a sole proprietorship is the feeling of pride and the personal satisfaction they gain from owning and running their own business.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retention of Profits:</strong> If your business is successful, all the profits go to you minus your personal taxes, of course.</p>\\n<p><strong>Possible Tax Advantage:</strong> No taxes are levied directly on the earnings of sole proprietorships as a business. Instead, the earnings are taxed only as income of the proprietor. As we’ll see when we discuss corporations, this avoids the undesirable possibility of double taxation of earnings.</p>\\n<p>Entrepreneurs thinking about forming sole proprietorships\\nshould also be aware of some serious drawbacks:</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Financial Resources:</strong> Raising money to finance growth can be tough for sole proprietors. With only one owner responsible for a sole proprietorship’s debts, banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend it money. Likewise, suppliers may be unwilling to provide supplies on credit. This leaves sole proprietors dependent on their own wealth plus the money that their firms generate.</p>\\n<p><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> Because the law views a sole proprietorship as an extension of its owner, the debts of the firm become the owner’s personal debts. If someone sues your business and wins, the court can seize your personal possessions—even those that have nothing to do with your business—and sell them to pay the damages. This unlimited personal liability means that operating as a sole proprietorship is a risky endeavor.</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Ability to Attract and Maintain Talented Employees:</strong> Most sole proprietors are unable to pay the high salaries and substantial perks that highly qualified, experienced employees get when they work for big, well-established companies.</p>\\n<p><strong>Heavy Workload and Responsibilities:</strong> Being your own boss can be very rewarding, but it can also mean very long hours and a lot of stress. Sole proprietors as the ultimate authority in their business—often must perform tasks or make decisions in areas where they lack expertise.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lack of Permanence:</strong> Because sole proprietorships are just extensions of their owners, they lack permanence. If the owner dies, retires, or withdraws from the business for some other reason, the company legally ceases to exist. Even if the company continues to operate under new ownership, in the eyes of the law, it becomes a different firm.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"62-partnerships-two-heads-and-bankrolls-can-be-better-than-one\\\"><a href=\\\"#62-partnerships-two-heads-and-bankrolls-can-be-better-than-one\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.2 Partnerships: Two heads (and bankrolls) can be better than one</h2>\\n<p>There is no limit on the number of partners who can participate in a general partnership, but most partnerships consist of only a few partners often just two. The partnership is formed when the partners enter into a voluntary partnership agreement. It is legally possible to start a partnership on the basis of a <strong>verbal agreement</strong>, but doing so is often a recipe for disaster. It’s much safer to get everything in writing and to seek expert legal assistance when drawing up the agreement. A typical partnership agreement spells out details, such as the initial financial contributions each partner will make, the specific duties and responsibilities each will assume, how they will share profits (and losses), how they will settle disagreements, and how they will deal with the death or withdrawal of one of the partners. Well written agreements can prevent common misunderstandings.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"621-advantages-of-general-partnerships\\\"><a href=\\\"#621-advantages-of-general-partnerships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.2.1 Advantages of General Partnerships</h3>\\n<p>Partnerships offer some key advantages relative to both sole proprietorships and corporations:</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Pool Financial Resources:</strong> With more owners investing in the company, a partnership is likely to have a stronger financial base than a sole proprietorship.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Share Responsibilities and Capitalize on Complementary Skills:</strong> Partners can share the burden of running the business, which can ease the workload. Tasks and jobs can also be divided based on complementary skills, using each partner’s talents to best advantage.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ease of Formation:</strong> In theory, forming a partnership is easy. As we’ve already noted, it’s possible (but not advisable) to establish a partnership based on a simple verbal agreement. But we shouldn’t overemphasize this advantage. Working out all of the details of a partnership agreement can sometimes be a complex and time consuming process.</p>\\n<p><strong>Possible Tax Advantages:</strong> Similar to a sole proprietorship, the earnings of a partnership “pass through” the business untouched by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are taxed only as the partners’ personal income. Again, this avoids the potential for double taxation endemic to corporations.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"621-disadvantages-of-general-partnerships\\\"><a href=\\\"#621-disadvantages-of-general-partnerships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.2.1 Disadvantages of General Partnerships</h3>\\n<p>General partnerships also have some serious disadvantages. Well-written partnership agreements, however, can mitigate some of these major drawbacks:</p>\\n<p><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> As a general partner, you’re not only liable for your own mistakes but also for those of your partners. In fact, all general partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of their business. So, if the assets they’ve invested in the business aren’t sufficient to meet these claims, the personal assets of the partners are at risk. When someone sues a general partnership, the lawsuit can target any individual partner or group of partners. In fact, lawsuits often go after the partners with the deepest pockets, even if they did not personally participate in the act that caused the legal action. In other words, if you have more personal wealth than the other partners, you could lose more than they do even if they were the ones at fault!</p>\\n<p><strong>Potential for Disagreements:</strong> If general partners can’t agree on how to run the business, the conflict can complicate and delay decision making. A well-drafted partnership agreement usually specifies how disputes will be resolved, but disagreements among partners can create friction and hard feelings that harm morale and undermine the cooperation needed to keep the business on track.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lack of Continuity:</strong> If a current partner <strong>withdraws</strong> from the partnership, the relationships among the participants will clearly change, potentially ending the partnership. This creates uncertainty about how long a partnership will remain in business.</p>\\n<p><strong>Difficulty in Withdrawing from a Partnership:</strong>\\nA partner who withdraws from a partnership remains personally liable for any debts or obligations the firm had at the time of withdrawal — even if those obligations were incurred by the actions of other partners.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"63-limited-partnership\\\"><a href=\\\"#63-limited-partnership\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.3 Limited Partnership</h2>\\n<p>The risks associated with unlimited liability make general partnerships unattractive to many individuals who would otherwise be interested in joining a business partnership. Fortunately, two other types of partnerships allow some partners to limit their personal liability to some extent, although each comes with particular requirements.</p>\\n<p>The first of these, known as a <strong>limited partnership</strong>, is a partnership arrangement that includes at least one general partner and at least one limited partner. Both types of partners contribute financially to the company and share in its profits. But in other respects they play different roles:</p>\\n<p>General partners have the right to participate fully in managing their partnership, but they also assume unlimited personal liability for any of its debts—just like the partners in a general partnership.</p>\\n<p>Limited partners cannot actively participate in its management, but they have the protection of limited liability. This means that, as long as they do not actively participate in managing the company, their personal wealth is not at risk.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"64-limited-liability-partnerships\\\"><a href=\\\"#64-limited-liability-partnerships\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.4 Limited Liability Partnerships</h2>\\n<p>The limited liability partnership (LLP) is another partnership arrangement that is attractive to partners who want to limit their personal risk. It is similar to a limited partnership in some ways, but it has the advantage of allowing all partners to take an active role in management, while also offering all partners some form of limited liability. In other words, there’s no need to distinguish between limited and general partners in an LLP.</p>\\n<p>The amount of liability protection offered by LLPs varies among states. In some states, LLPs offer “full-shield” protection, meaning that partners have limited liability for all claims against their company, except those resulting from their own negligence or malpractice. In other states, partners in LLPs have a lesser “partial-shield” protection. In these states, each partner has limited liability for the negligence or malpractice of other partners but still has unlimited liability for any other debts. Another drawback is that some states only allow specific types of professional businesses to form limited liability partnerships. For example, California law allows only accountants, lawyers, and architects to form LLPs.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"65-corporations-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-being-an-artificial-person\\\"><a href=\\\"#65-corporations-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-being-an-artificial-person\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5 Corporations: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being an Artificial Person</h2>\\n<p>There are several types of corporations.

Forming a C Corporation</h3>\\n<p>As mentioned earlier, the formation of a corporation requires filing articles of incorporation and paying filing fees. It also requires the adoption of corporate bylaws, which are detailed rules that govern the way the corporation is organized and managed. Because of these requirements, forming a corporation tends to be more expensive and complex than forming a sole proprietorship or partnership. The requirements, however, vary among the country.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"652-ownership-of-c-corporations\\\"><a href=\\\"#652-ownership-of-c-corporations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.2. Ownership of C Corporations</h3>\\n<p>Ownership of C corporations is represented by shares of stock, so owners are called “<strong>stockholders</strong>” (or “shareholders”). Common stock represents the basic ownership interest in a corporation, but some firms also issue <strong>preferred stock</strong>. One key difference between the two types of stock involves <strong>voting rights</strong>; common stockholders normally have the right to vote in stockholders’ meetings, while preferred stockholders do not. Many large corporations issue billions of shares of stock and have hundreds of thousands or even millions of stockholders.\\nStock in large corporations is usually publicly traded, meaning that anyone with the money and inclination to do so can buy shares and that anyone who owns shares is free to sell them. But many smaller corporations are owned by just a handful of stockholders who don’t actively trade their stock. It’s even possible for individuals to incorporate their business and be the sole shareholder in their corporation.</p>\\n<p>Stockholders don’t have to be individuals. Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and endowment funds, pool money from a large number of individuals and use these funds to buy stocks and other securities. Investors own the majority of stock in many large corporations.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"653-the-role-of-the-board-of-directors\\\"><a href=\\\"#653-the-role-of-the-board-of-directors\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.3. The Role of the Board of Directors</h3>\\n<p>It’s not practical for all of the stockholders of a large corporation to actively participate in the management of their company. Besides, most stockholders don’t have the time, management skills, or desire to effectively manage such a complex business enterprise. Thus, in accordance with corporate bylaws, the stockholders elect a board of directors and rely on this board to oversee the operation of their company and protect their interests.</p>\\n<p>The board of directors establishes the corporation’s mission and sets its broad objectives. But board members seldom take an active role in the day-to-day management of their company. Instead, again in accordance with corporate bylaws, the board appoints a chief executive officer (CEO) and other corporate officers to manage the company on a daily basis. The board also sets the level of compensation for these officers and monitors their performance to ensure that they act in a manner consistent with stockholder interests. It also provides advice to these officers on broad policy issues, approves their major proposals, and ensures that the company adheres to major regulatory requirements.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"654-advantages-of-c-corporations\\\"><a href=\\\"#654-advantages-of-c-corporations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.4 Advantages of C Corporations</h3>\\n<p>Corporations have become the dominant form of business ownership for several reasons:</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> As already explained, stockholders are not personally liable for the debts of their company. If a corporation goes bankrupt, the stockholders might find that their stock is worthless, but their other personal assets are protected.</p>\\n<p><strong>Permanence:</strong> Unless the articles of incorporation specify a limited duration, corporations can continue operating as long as they <strong>remain financially viable</strong> and the majority of stockholders want the business to continue. Unlike a sole proprietorship or partnership, a general corporation is unaffected by the death or withdrawal of an owner.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ease of Transfer of Ownership:</strong> It’s easy for stockholders of publicly traded C corporations to withdraw from ownership—they simply sell their shares of stock.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Raise Large Amounts of Financial Capital:</strong> Corporations can raise large amounts of financial capital by issuing shares of stock or by selling formal IOUs called corporate bonds. The ability to raise money by issuing these securities gives corporations a major financial advantage over most other forms of ownership.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ability to Make Use of Specialized Management:</strong> Large corporations often find it easier to hire <strong>highly qualified professional</strong> managers than proprietorships and partnerships. Major corpora- tions can typically offer attractive salaries and benefits, and their permanence and potential for growth offer managers opportunities for career advancement.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"655-disadvantages-of-c-corporations\\\"><a href=\\\"#655-disadvantages-of-c-corporations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.5. Disadvantages of C Corporations</h3>\\n<p>In addition to their significant benefits, C corporations\\nhave a number of drawbacks:</p>\\n<p><strong>Expense and Complexity of Formation and Operation:</strong> As we’ve already seen, establishing a corporation can be more complex and expensive than forming a sole proprietorship or partnership. Corporations are also subject to more formal operating requirements. For example, they are required to hold regular board meetings and keep accurate minutes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Double Taxation of Earnings and Additional Taxes:</strong> The IRS considers a C corporation to be a sep- arate legal entity and taxes its earnings accordingly. Then, as shown in Exhibit 6.4, any dividends (earnings the corporation distributes to stockholders) are taxed again as the personal income of the stockholders. This double taxation can take a big bite out of earn- ings that are distributed to shareholders. But note that corporations often reinvest some or all of their profits back into the business. Shareholders don’t pay income taxes on these retained earnings. Many states also impose separate income taxes on corporations. Most states also impose an annual franchise tax on both domestic and foreign corporations that operate within their borders.</p>\\n<p><strong>More Paperwork, More Regulation, and Less Secrecy:</strong> Corporations are more closely regulated and are required to file more <strong>government paperwork</strong> than other forms of business. Large, publicly traded corporations are required to send annual statements to all shareholders and to file detailed quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The annual report filed with the SEC (called a Form 10-K) is often hundreds of pages long and includes a wealth of information about the company’s operations and financial condition. Anyone can look at these forms, making it difficult to keep key corporate information secret from competitors.</p>\\n<p><strong>Possible Conflicts of Interest:</strong> The corporate officers appointed by the board are supposed to further the interests of stockholders. But some top executives pursue policies that further their own interests (such as prestige, power, job security, high pay, and attractive perks) at the expense of the stockholders. The board of directors has an obligation to protect the interests of stockholders, but in recent years the boards of several major corporations have come under criticism for continuing to approve high compensation packages for top executives even when their companies performed poorly.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"656-other-types-of-corporations-same-but-different\\\"><a href=\\\"#656-other-types-of-corporations-same-but-different\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.6. Other Types of Corporations: Same but Different</h3>\\n<p>Now that we’ve described C corporations, let’s take a quick look at three other types of corporations: <strong>S corporations</strong>, <strong>statutory close corporations</strong>, and <strong>nonprofit corporations</strong>. Like C corporations, each is created by filing the appropriate paperwork with a government agency. Also like general corporations, these corporations are considered legal entities that stand apart from their owners and can enter into contracts, own property, and take legal action in their own names. But in other key respects they are quite different from C corporations and from each other.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"657-corporate-restructuring\\\"><a href=\\\"#657-corporate-restructuring\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.5.7 Corporate Restructuring</h3>\\n<p>Large corporations constantly look for ways to grow and achieve competitive advantages. Some corporations work to achieve these goals, at least in part, through mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. We’ll close our discussion of corporations by taking a quick look at these forms of corporate restructuring.</p>\\n<p><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions</strong> In the news and casual conversation, the terms “merger” and “acquisition” are often used interchangeably. However, there’s a difference between the two. An <strong>acquisition</strong> occurs when one firm buys another firm. The firm making the purchase is called the “acquiring firm,” and the firm being purchased is called the “target firm.” After the acquisition, the target firm ceases to exist as an independent entity while the purchasing firm continues in operation, and its stock is still traded. But not all acquisitions are on friendly terms. When the acquiring firm buys the target firm despite the opposition of the target’s board and top management, the result is called a “hostile takeover.”</p>\\n<p>In a <strong>merger</strong>, instead of one firm buying the other, the two companies agree to a combination of equals, joining together to form a new company out of the two previously independent firms.</p>\\n<p><strong>Divestitures: When Less Is More</strong> Sometimes corporations restructure by subtraction rather than by ad dition. A <strong>divestiture</strong> occurs when a firm transfers total or partial ownership of some of its operations to investors or to another company. Firms of ten use divestitures to rid themselves of a part of their company that no longer fits well with their strategic plans. This allows them to streamline their operations and focus on their core businesses. In many (but not all) cases, divestitures involve the sale of assets to outsiders, which raises financial capital for the firm.</p>\\n<p>One common type of divestiture, called a “spin-off,” occurs when a company issues stock in one of its own divisions or operating units and sets it up as a separate company complete with its own board of directors and corporate officers. It then distributes the stock in the new company to its existing stockholders. After the spin-off, the stockholders end up owning two separate companies rather than one. They can then buy, sell, or hold either (or both) stocks as they see fit. While a spin-off allows a corporation to eliminate a division that no longer fits in its plans, it doesn’t actually generate any additional funds for the firm.</p>\\n<p>A “carve-out” is like a spin-off in that the firm converts a particular unit or division into a separate company and issues stock in the newly created corporation. However, instead of distributing the new stock to its current stockholders, it sells the stock to outside investors, thus raising additional financial capital. In many cases, the firm sells only a minor- ity of the total shares, so that it maintains majority ownership.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"66-the-limited-liability-company-the-new-kid-on-the-block\\\"><a href=\\\"#66-the-limited-liability-company-the-new-kid-on-the-block\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>6.6 THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY: THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK</h2>\\n<p>As the newest form of business ownership, state laws concerning the legal status and formation of LLCs are still evolving.

As with corporations, LLCs are created by filing a document (which goes by a variety of names, such as certificate of organization or articles of organization) and paying filing fees in the state where the business is organized. Organizers of most LLCs also draft an operating agreement, which is similar to the bylaws of a corporation. Some states also require LLCs to publish a notice of intent to operate as a limited liability company. </p>\\n<p>Because LLCs are neither corporations nor partnerships, their owners are called members rather than stockholders or partners. Members of LLCs often manage their own company under an arrangement similar to the relationship among general partners in a partnership.

Advantages of LLCs</h3>\\n<p>Why are LLCs becoming so popular? This form of owner-\\nship offers significant advantages:</p>\\n<p><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> Similar to a corporation, all owners of an LLC have limited liability.</p>\\n<p><strong>Tax Pass-Through:</strong> As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, for tax purposes the owners of LLCs may elect to have their companies treated as either a corporation or a partnership—or even as a sole proprietorship if owned by a single person. The default tax classification for LLCs with more than one owner—and the one most LLCs choose—is the partnership option. Under this arrangement, there is no rations, the owners of LLCs can include foreign investors and other corporations. However, some states do make it difficult to transfer ownership to outsiders. separate tax on the earnings of the company. Instead, earnings “pass through” the company and are taxed only as income of the owners. This eliminates the double taxation of profits that is endemic to general corporations. However, there are some cases where it makes sense for LLCs to elect to be taxed as a corporation. For example, the owner of a single-person LLC can avoid paying self-employment taxes by electing to have the LLC treated as a corporation rather than as a sole proprietorship.</p>\\n<p><strong>Simplicity and Flexibility in Management and Operation:</strong> Unlike corporations, LLCs aren’t required to hold regular board meetings. Also, LLCs are subject to less paperwork and fewer reporting requirements than corporations.</p>\\n<p><strong>Flexible Ownership:</strong> Unlike S corporations, LLCs can have any number of owners. Also unlike S corporations, the owners of LLCs can include foreign investors and other corporations.

In general, forming an LLC is also more difficult than creating\\na partnership. But as we mentioned earlier, the formation of a partnership requires a “meeting of the minds” of the partners, which isn’t always easy to achieve. So in some cases, the formation of a partnership can prove to be every bit as challenging as the formation of an LLC.\\ntheir increasing popularity, LLCs</p>\\n<p><strong>Annual Franchise Tax:</strong> Even though they may be exempt from corporate income taxes, many states require LLCs to pay an annual franchise tax. Foreign Status in Other States: Like corporations, LLCs must register or qualify to operate as “foreign” companies when they do business in states other than the state in which they were organized. This results in additional paperwork, fees, and taxes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Limits on Types of Firms that Can Form LLCs:</strong> Most states do not permit banks, insurance companies, and nonprofit organizations to operate as LLCs.</p>\\n<p><strong>Differences in State Laws:</strong> As we’ve already mentioned, LLC laws are still evolving—and their specific requirements vary considerably among the states. In 2006, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws created a Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act that could be used as a model by all states.
