What is accounting?</h2>\n<p>Accounting is about identifying, recording and presenting information; it is the forward scout in your business operations, surveying the landscape, and taking stock of your own position, so you know where you stand, what your weaknesses are, and where you should be allocating your resources.</p>\n<p>Who uses the information that accounting provides? It’s a\nlong list (Managers, Stockholders, Employees, Creditors, Suppliers, Government agencies); after all, everyone wants to make good decisions!\nIn fact, a variety of business stakeholders rely so heavily on\naccounting information that it’s sometimes called the “language\nof business.”</p>\n<p>We generally break down accounting into two main fields:</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Accounting</strong> is the branch of accounting that addresses the needs of external stakeholders, including stockholders, creditors, and government regulators. These stakeholders are seldom interested in poring over detailed accounting information about the individual departments or divisions within a company. Instead, they’re interested in the financial performance of the firm as a whole. They often want to know how a firm’s financial condition has changed over a period of several years, or to compare its results to those of other firms in the same industry. The major output of financial accounting is a set of financial statements designed to provide this broad type of information.</p>\n<p><strong>Managerial Accounting</strong> as its name implies, this branch of accounting is designed to meet the needs of a company’s managers, though in recent years many firms have empowered other employees and given them access to some of this information as well. Managers throughout an organization rely on information created by managerial accountants to make important decisions. The accuracy and reliability of this information can make a huge difference in the performance of a firm. In fact, many firms view their management accounting systems as a source of competitive advantage and regard the specifics of these systems as highly valuable company secrets.</p>\n<iframe width="830" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iH7wwku52Ck" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3 id="11-accounting-who-does-it"><a href="#11-accounting-who-does-it" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>1.1.

The Balance Sheet</h2>\n<p>The balance sheet summarizes a firm’s financial position at a <strong>specific point in time</strong>. Though the balance sheets of different firms vary in specifics, all of them are organized to reflect the most famous equation in all of accounting — so famous that it is usually referred to simply as the accounting equation: <strong>Assets</strong> <strong>=</strong> <strong>Liabilities</strong> <strong>+</strong> <strong>Owners</strong> <strong>Equity</strong></p>\n<iframe width="820" height="430" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGBOPV8q6oY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong> are things of value that the firm owns.</p>\n<p><strong>Liabilities</strong> indicate what the firm owes to nonowners—in other words, the claims nonowners have against the firm’s assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Owners’ equity</strong> the claims a firm’s owners have against their company’s assets (often called “stockholders’ equity” on balance sheets of corporations).</p>\n<p>The logic behind the accounting equation is based on the fact that firms must finance the purchase of their assets,\nand owners and nonowners are the only two sources\nof funding. The accounting equation tells us that the value\nof a firm’s assets must equal the amount of financing provided\nby owners (as measured by owners’ equity) plus the\namount provided by creditors (as indicated by the firm’s liabilities)\nto purchase those assets. Because a balance sheet\nis based on this logic, it must always be in balance. In other\nwords, the dollar value of the assets must equal the dollar\nvalue of the liabilities plus\nowners’ equity. This is true\nfor all firms, from the smallest\nsole proprietorship to\nthe largest multinational\ncorporation.</p>\n<h3 id="23-the-income-statement"><a href="#23-the-income-statement" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>2.3.

Cash is the lifeblood of any business organization.\nA firm must have enough cash to pay what it owes to\nworkers, creditors, suppliers, and taxing authorities—hopefully,\nwith enough left to pay a dividend to its owners! So\nit’s not surprising that a firm’s stakeholders are very interested\nin how and why a company’s cash balance changed\nover the past year. Cash flow statements commonly begin\nwith net income.</p>\n<p>The statement of cash flows looks at the “liquidity” of a company, in other words how much spendable cash it has at any given time.</p>\n<p>It breaks up the cash activities into three categories: Operations, Investing, and Financing Activities.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cash flows from <strong>operating\nactivities</strong> show the amount\nof cash that flowed into the\ncompany from the sale of goods or services, as well\nas cash from dividends and interest received from\nownership of the financial securities of other firms.

A firm’s management accounting system helps managers throughout an organization measure costs and assign them to products, activities, and even whole divisions. Accountants define cost as the value of what is given up in exchange for something else. Depending on the type of problem they are analyzing, managerial accountants actually measure and evaluate several different types of costs. We’ll begin our discussion by describing some of the cost concepts commonly used by managerial accountants. At the most basic level, accountants distinguish between out-of-pocket costs and opportunity costs. <strong>Out-of-pocket</strong> costs (also called explicit costs) are usually easy to measure because they involve actual expenditures of money or other resources. The wages a company pays to its workers, the payments it makes to suppliers for raw materials, and the rent it pays for office\nspace are examples. But accountants realize that not all costs involve a\nmonetary payment; sometimes what is given up is the opportunity\nto use an asset in some alternative way. Such opportunity\ncosts are often referred to as <strong>implicit costs</strong>. For\nexample, suppose a couple of lawyers form a partnership\nand set up their office in a building one of the partners\nalready owns. They feel good about their decision because\nthey don’t have to make any out-of-pocket payments for\nrent. But a good managerial accountant would point out\nto the partners that they still incur an implicit cost, because by using the building themselves they forgo the opportunity\nto earn income by renting the office space to someone\nelse.</p>\n<p>Managerial accountants also distinguish between fixed costs and variable costs. As the name implies,\n<strong>fixed costs</strong> don’t change when the firm changes its\nlevel of production. Examples of fixed costs include\ninterest on a bank loan, property insurance premiums,\nrent on office space, and other payments that are set\nby a contract or by legal requirements. Many fixed costs\nare really only fixed for some “relevant range” of output.\nFor example, if a company sees a dramatic rise in sales, it\nmight have to move into bigger facilities, thus incurring\na higher rent.\n<strong>Variable costs</strong> are costs that rise (vary) when\nthe firm produces more of its goods and services. As a\ncompany ramps up its production, it is likely to need more\nlabor and materials and to use more electrical power. Thus\npayments for many types of labor, supplies, and utilities are\nvariable costs.</p>\n<h2 id="4-the-stock-exchange"><a href="#4-the-stock-exchange" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>4.
